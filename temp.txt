i would politely try to discuss why i need off that week with my colleague and see if we can work out some sort of deal if they would be willing to let me have off , i would offer to buy them a gift card or lunch if they would n't be willing to let me have off i would report to my manager i would try to stay as ahead as i can i would try to complete the project well before the due date this way , if my manager were to give me extra tasks before its due , i do not have to worry about completing the project i would still go to the meeting i would go because it is a big client , and it is important that you worry about yourself , and making a good impression , regardless if your coworker is going or not the client would be disappointed and turned off if no one went i would ask to speak with the manager more about the feedback find out specifics about what you are doing wrong and figure out ways to improve if the feedback is completley false , i would possibly start to look for other job alternatives i would find this experience enjoyable i like to learn about different cultures and countries i would be willing to travel as well if it were necessary
i would find out why they want need the week off if they needed the week off for a particular reason and i had flexibility in my week off , i would just adjust my request however , if the co worker did not have plans and or i had something scheduled , i would end up filing a grievance with the union i would do the bulk of the work right away so that it was done and ready to go that way if i was assigned another project , i would have time to get it done if i end up with no other projects , i can always tweak and improve the first project more i would pressure my work colleague into going with me going alone without knowing anyone else is a horrible situation i think i could pressure them to go with me since it is a large client i would explain to my manager that i did not understand the feedback and ask if they could clarify or explain further to help me understand it i would be to try and understand my managers point of view and reason for the feedback once i understood the true reason , i would attempt to explain my perspective in a non confrontational manner and provide a way out for the manager without looking like they are backing down or were wrong basically , try to characterize as a misunderstanding i would find the experience enjoyable i have always found northern europe to be an interesting place with a rich history and would enjoy having the chance to interact with people from that area its always interesting learning the unique things about a different culture
i would consider if i was able to change my plans if my plans were booked and unable to be changed then i would approach my colleague if they also had plans made like this , then we would have to speak with the supervisor it would not be fair for me to waste money if they did have a refundable i would plan a timeline immediately for the project i would also make a list of each objective to be achieved putting things off would be bad and unproductive i definitely would try to achieve as much as possible early i would go with or without them networking is very important for career furthering and if my colleague cannot see that than that is their problem i would prefer them to be able to go with me , but if not it woudl still be worth it i would approach them about the feedback i would want to have a conversation about what they were talking about it would give me a chance to defend myself and my actions if this did not go anywhere i would consider speaking to hr i would enjoy this because it would give me a chance to make connections and broaden my horizons if i ended up traveling there one day for business or pleasure it would be useful as well any chance to work with a client would also be good for a career
i would reconsider my plans , and see if they were more flexible than my co worker 's if they were n't , then i would talk to my co worker to see what their plans were , and if it was a scheduling issue , or their stubborn self not wanted to switch weeks most likely though , as i'm very good at planning , i would most likely relinquish the week , as i would n't plan my vacation until i received the go ahead from my boss i would finish my project as soon as possible then i would get started on the other work until it was finished after submitting it to my boss , i would fine tooth comb my project before the due date i would not want to go to the meeting anyways so , i would breathe easy knowing i would n't be hassled into going by my friend i would see no point in going i would immediately go to discuss it with my manager if we did n't see eye to eye , and his her explanation did n't satisfy me , and i was still 100 certain that i was n't in the wrong , i 'd go over their head i would then bring my issue up to the higher ups , and seek a good resolution there i would probably find it boring norway does n't sound that interesting , honestly , and i would probably have other work to do i guess it would n't be bad , but i would n't be excited at all about it
i would first talk to my colleague about changing their vacation week if that did n't work i would talk to my supervisor i would ask who requested to have the week off first if my colleague asked first then i would change my vacation week if not , i would ask that my supervisor tell them to change their vacation i would go ahead and start working on the project i would get the more time consuming things done first so when it got close to the due date i would be almost done then , if my boss gave me last minute task i would have plenty of time to get everything done i would ask my colleague to attend this meeting with me because it is important to know your clients if they did not want to come i would go by myself it would be in my best interest to attend the meeting regardless of what my colleague chooses to do i would review the feedback and then talk with my manager if i felt like my manager was being unfair then i would have to speak with someone higher up i would n't take a negative feedback knowing that it was n't true and losing money i would find this to be enjoyable i really like learning new things about different countries and their cultures it would be time well spent plus a great bonus to add to my resume
i would change my vacation plans i would be happy to be amenable in the workplace i would think it more important to be considered a generous , giving team player than to have my preferred week of vacation rather than be annoyed , i would think that my flexibility reflects positively upon me i would try to complete as much of the project as early as possible knowing that i may get late assignments that would pull me off task , i would take advantage of having time early on to ensure i am on track and get all external information from other parties and partners this will allow me to plan my own project time effectively i would wait to submit the work until closer to the deadline nonetheless , giving myself time for review and corrections where necessary i would go nonetheless i would consider it part of my job , however uncomfortable especially if my colleague is not there , i would think it all the more important to represent our company i would put on my game face an ensure i was present and active as a representative of my team i would compile written information in order to refute the feedback i would collect recent successes and evaluation data relevant to my work to show the many positive impacts that i have had i would professionally send the document to my manager and request a follow up meeting to discuss and reassess their feedback i would find the experience especially enjoyable i love learning about new cultures and would be delighted to expand my knowledge of a country where i have no experience i would voraciously consume media related to the country , including histories , recent news and events , their pop culture , and otherwise even if i did not use the full set of new knowledge on the project , i would be thrilled to have the knowledge nonetheless
i would let my colleague take his vacation and i would stay behind i would do this because i do not feel it is a big deal to postpone my vacation until later i feel that both of us are going to get our vacations one way or the other so it does not matter who gets their vacation first i would work slower than usual i would do this so that i can stay busy with this project the whole time that would fool my boss into thinking that he cannot dump more work on top of me i would ask my colleague to go there with me otherwise i will not know anyone there if he does not want to go with me i will simply go by myself i will successfully network with others even though i do not know anyone i would try to speak to my manager about the issue at hand if i feel the manager 's response was not to my liking then i would go to his manager everyone has a boss and i feel i would do whatever i can to make sure this situation is resolved in my favor i would find this experience boring because i do not care about the culture of norway i would find it boring because when i come to work i do just enough to get by i am not interested in doing anything extra with a client from norway
i would , go a head and change my vacation to another week but i would tell my boss that it would be my firm decision sometimes you just have to give in i would go a head and do the project even if it cause me to get back up i would do it because my boss may give me credit knowing i could carry out projects making me look good at my job well there are times when you must stand on your own just because you want know anyone is just a excuse to and mingle and make new friends i would ask my manager to give proof in the negative feedback or how i could change it if is for real maybe do something to improve the negativity i would find it enjoyable , learning new info about a different country would be educational someday you might get the chance to visit and know a lot about norway
i would let my colleague have their vacation , but i would make sure to let my supervisor know that i'm being the bigger person i 'd also ask for first dibs on vacation time if a new conflict ever arises in the future i 'd hope that my colleague would be appreciative of my sacrifice i would get started on my project i 'd try to get as much work done on it as possible that first week , so that if something else arises , i wo n't be stressed i 'd want to make sure that i'm done at least a couple of days prior to the due date i would try to convince my colleague to go i would offer to buy my colleague dinner if they went but if he said no , i would n't push too hard and i 'd go alone i would be really upset i 'd try and talk with my co workers and get their thoughts on the situation i might try and talk with my manager i 'd also try to let my manager 's boss know that what he said is not true i would find the experience enjoyable because it 's different from work i like to learn about other countries it would be a good excuse to try new things and new foods
i would first consider the reason in requesting the time off is the week requested just a week i 'd like to have , or something more important such as a wedding in the family , etc i would have a conversation with my colleague about why the specific dates were requested then possibly review who put the request in first i would handle this project by completing as much as i could leading up to the due date a majority of the project would be completed , slight changes could be made and anything given by the boss that takes significant time could be handled as well deadlines can be stressful so there is no need to put things off until the last minute during a time of light work i would probably lean towards not going as well i would lean towards not going because it would be hard network fully after a long day along with not knowing anyone i would also lean more towards that decision due to it sounding like a last minute invite i would n't be happy bout the feedback and the situation would make me angry due to the consequences possibly involved i would not confront my boss over this i would work extremely hard to disprove the feedback given as i do not feel it to be true i would find this experience enjoyable it is always fun to learn and explore a countries culture knowledge of different cultures is always good to have for future deals with clients and or travel
i would speak to my colleague individuallly to see if we could work it out without management involvement assuming both of us needed the same week and neither could change plans , a decision would have to be made i would try to accomodate the request of the other , but if that was not possible , the supervisor would have ot make a decisioni would take advantage of the time and get a good start on the project , especially if my boss surprises me on a routine basis not doing so could cause me to fall behind or not meet expectationsi would go cannot pass up opportunities like this , regardless if the other person can go not only is this good for my current position and relationship with the client , it 's good for future opportunities as well not going is missing out on a critical opportunity i would feel i was being unfairly singled out i would ask for specific documentation on the source of the feedback i would state that i need time to review the situation and would seek advice or guidance on how to improve in the future depending on the severity , the source , etc , i may escalate to hr , or other authority i would find it enjoyable first , it is a great opportunity to learn something new and increase my stock with the organization its always good to increase your value second , it would be good to be involved in a project where i could get paid to learn about aother places
i would have a conversation with my colleague and ask why they were inflexible on their plans if my plans did not involve airline tickets and hotel stays already paid for , i could be flexible i would have everything of importance completed ahead of time to leave room for surprise changes or additions i would go anyway and make new connections i really do n't need another person with me when i attend such events i would feel that i should have a right to dispute and would request that i would sit with my boss and have a conversation regarding this decision i would find it quite enjoyable research is something i relish and i would take this on with no problem
i would let my colleague take it if they are so insistent upon it i could take it another week and i 'd be doing a solid for someone else which is always good it would give me more time to plan my vacation as well i would just do the project right away that way it is done and if any changes are needed then i can just go back and make changes i would turn it in at the time of the due date to be sure but i would take my time with it i would go because i think the opportunity would be worth it i may not know anyone there but i think i would get to know people and that would be the point for me i would explain to my manager why he was wrong i would also try my best to show him that it just is n't true and show that i'm willing to change his opinion i think the best thing i could do is show through action that he is wrong i would find it enjoyable because it would be fun to travel even if i were traveling just for work it would at least make my job more interesting it would at least provide a story to tell
i would ask to see who had greater seniority then id negotoate on possibly on another window of time where we could do this i lastly ask about paid vacation i would ask for some freer time so i could finish my project i would also ask for an extension as a backup i 'd see what my options were i would anyways as it a good gesture it also an opportunity to network and grow id lastly see if i could bring business cards i would refute the allegations as well as pin down where i was lacking i would also speak to hr and understand rights lastly i would probably look for a plan b in terms of enemployemt , i would find this enjoyable an opportunity to expand is an opportunity to grown im certain someone would want to volunteer
i would have a conversation with both my colleague and supervisor to discuss what can be done about the situation depending on who has a more important engagement during their vacation if my colleagues was more important i would n't have a problem giving them the week i would expect my colleague to extend the same gratitude if a similar situation came up in the future i would work on the project immediately this would give me time to compensate for any time i would need to work on last minute tasks if needed it would also give me a chance to complete the project if possible reducing the chance of not making the deadline i would try to talk my colleague into going to the networking meeting i think it could be a great business opportunity if my colleague does n't end up going to the networking meeting i would go any way i would give myself time to evaluate the feedback i received this would impact my current role and how i feel about my work environment i would ask to have a meeting with all involved in the situation , so that it can be talked through i would find this boring because i would n't get to go to the country i would find it more beneficial for the project to travel to norway this would provide a first hand experience of the country
i would try to reason with him , and then probably punch him in the face , cause im sick of him doing that stuff to me he 's usually a jerk to me at work and constantly harassing me to do his job while hes lazy but i would end up being the bigger man and just change mine i would immediately start the project , because i would rather be safe then sorry if my boss is known to add last minute tasks then it 's better for me to be prepared for that and work harder to finish my tasks i would go , because networking is how you advance in some industries in business professionalism helps you land new clients and work harder , as well as make your company look more reactive to situations that arise i would speak with him and express my discontent i then would explain all the reasons why i feel that way and what i have done to better benefit the company i would acknowledge any true feedback and take it to heart but i would still fight for myself i would try to avoid this , because i do n't have time usually between school work and other life necessities so i would pass on the opportunity not because of being boring but because time management is not fully efficient in my life
if my vacation is not an emergency and i have not purchased a flight or airline tickets , i would talk to my colleague to see if they have done so most likely i would let my colleague have the week off i would be sure to schedule my next vacation way ahead of time i would speak with my boss and advise him or her that during the next two weeks i can not take on any last minute tasks i would do this because i do not want to become over whelmed and not do good on my project i would want to be successful in completing my project i would go to the networking meeting i would meet new people this is why i would go i would not want to miss an opportunity to meet one of our largest clientsi would be upset i would figure out what i can do to correct the problem to make sure it does not happen in the future i would do something above and beyond the call of duty to assure that i get my bonusi would find this experience very enjoyable i love learning about other countries it is very important to know about other countries then the one you live in
i usually do n't book vacations until i know i can take time off so i would change my week it also would make me feel better that i did n't have to make someone change their plans plus , we should always keep the boss happy i would probably talk to my boss and ask him ahead of time if he night have some last minute tasks related to the project that way i could be ahead of the game i would also make sure that i did as much of the work as i could on the project so i could have a little extra time to make sure everything was just right i would encourage my colleague to go to the meeting with me perhaps i would bring up something that i had done recently for him or her to seal the deal i would also encourage by saying that it will look good when our boss finds out that we both went i would feel quite upset , but would probably go back to my manager ans see if the damage can be repaired could i have more training in the area that was lacking or could i shadow someone else who has positive feedback so i can learn from my mistake i would probably find the experience enjoyable because i like to learn about different cultures this is quite easy now with the internet plus it also makes the job a little bit different so it would n't be the same old stuff
i would take the liberty to change my plans i do n't mind working an extra week , so long as i get my time so long as business runs smoothly , i'm happy i would get as much work done as early as possible i 'd also pace out the work so as to be thorough i 'd take any free time outside of my workload to work on the project so it 's as if i had a full load to begin with i would go by myself networking can be worth more personally than with business this also can help you bridge work relationships i would reflect on myself i would question why my manager feels the way i feel from there i 'd understand their point of view and take their advice i would find this experience boring if it were without travel i believe you have to immerse yourself within the culture to truly understand it many things ca n't be learned just through online research
i would talk with my colleague because they have plans they ca n't change if i'm not going anywhere , perhaps i would change my week even if i had made the request first i would at least be willing to compromise if i could if they had made the request before i did , then i would simply have to change my week i would begin work on this project immediately even though my workload is light , i would not want any last minute tasks to get in the way of completing this project since i already know my boss sometimes give me tasks at the last minute , i would need to keep that in mind as i work to complete the project at hand i would first find out why my colleague would rather not attend since it 's one my largest clients , i see it as a benefit to attending , not just for me but my colleague as well i would explain my thoughts to my colleague in hopes that they would agree i would do my best to convince them just how important the meeting is to our firm i would probably beg if i had to i would definitely not feel good at all i would set up a meeting with my manager to discuss it i would try to find out exactly how and or why they came to give negative feedback instead of positive i would want to know why i was n't told sooner , maybe it 's something that could have been corrected early on i would find it an enjoyable experience it 's always good to learn about other cultures and countries even if you never travel there but if you can travel there that would be great too if it was possible
it would depend on who has been there the longest and if my plans could be changed if i have an airline ticket or reservations than cannot be changed without penalty , i would fight it if i can change them without losing money and the co worker is someone i normally get along with , i would change my vacation i would probably go ahead and continue with the project and if my boss gave me unexpected tasks at the last minute , i would ask for assistance , bearing in mind that i rarely ask for help i would ask them to reconsider and owe them a favor like maybe paying for lunch i would take the matter up with hr especially if i know this is n't true and the matter is serious it would depend a lot on my rapport with my supervisor if they are someone i can talk to and they should know me after a number of years with a company , i would confide in them otherwise it is a matter for hr to assist enjoyable norway is a country i would probably like to learn more about since it is relatively unfamiliar to me i would not have a problem learning more about the culture
i would see if i could change my vacation plans to another week because that would be the easiest way to deal with the situation i would talk to my family to see if they are okay with that because their schedules have to sync up with mine i would talk to my colleague to see if there is anything i can do to get them to change it because sometimes people can change their minds if you present them with an alternative they like i would make a list of what i needed to do in the project because i would want to visually see what all needed to be done i would get the hardest stuff out of the way first because i want to prevent having a lot of work towards the end i would see if anyone is available to help me throughout the process because that would make it a lot easier for me and make it more likely to have a better result i would first try to talk my coworker into going and see if there was any way i could get them to go i would remind them that it is a great opportunity for advancement and to make connections i would go without them if they still did n't want to go because i want to try to meet new people that could help me in the future i would only stay a short time if i went alone because i would feel awkward being there by myself i would take what my manager said to heart and ask my coworkers if they felt the same way about me i would try my best to change in the desired direction to improve my next feedback i would feel like i improperly judged my own performance at work and would feel guilty that i was n't being my best i would keep the feedback in the back of my mind to try to improve myself i would find the experience enjoyable because it would be a unique opportunity i would like it because i like learning about other cultures and would get to meet different people i would find the process of learning new things to be enjoyable and challenging me to be better i would also be able to use my new knowledge to help me with future projects
i would probably agree to my colleagues demands however , i would expect something in return , as i m doing them a favor by cancelling my plans i would expect them to help me with certain work tasks either when i return or during my own vacation , in return for rescheduling my vacation i would try to finish my projection as quickly as possible i would want to be sure i had a few extra days left before my deadline that way i could be sure inhad the time to complete any last minutes projects my boss sent my way without compromising my main work i would probably go i wouldn t want to alienate one of our most important client it would also be a chance to network with other people in the business plus , on a more mercenary note , it might reflect well on me that i went while the coworker bailed i would explain my feelings to my manager being as diplomatic as possible , i would detail the reasons i believed his assessment was incorrect if that didn t work , i might take the risk of going over his head , speaking to his boss about the situation , i would be happy to volunteer i think it would be very enjoyable i love learning about the history and culture of others nations in my free time doing it for a work project would be right up my alley
i would first try and talk with the other colleague and see if there would be a way to compromise i would see if it would be possible to maybe change a few of both of our dates of vacation so that maybe we could split the week up , but also add parts of the weeks on either side if this does n't seem to be something that will work , i would look at changing my vacation plans and what my other options would be i would do my best to try and start the project early i would plan to do at least a little bit each day this way , i could possibly finish early , but also if more last minute work is assigned , i will have time to work on that work i would try and talk to my colleague about reconsidering i would explain that i feel the same way about going after a long day , but hope that we can come to an agreement to both go and just not stay long hopefully we could compromise on a set time to at least go for a little while if we get there and decide to stay longer we can i would feel very upset and frustrated i would try and take some time to look at the situation and really think about what happened i would then ask if my manager were available to discuss the situation more , but after giving myself sometime to reflect on it i may also reach out to someone i trust to see if they have any advice on how to handle the situation from an outside point of view i would think this would be very enjoyable i think learning new cultures and different ways of life in other countries can be very interesting i would also feel excited that i was chosen to be the one to take on this task
i would first speak to my colleague and find out why he she is n't willing to change their plans then if they tell me their plans are set and i ca n't do anything to change their minds , i would adjust my plans and take my vacation another week because one , i do n't want to leave my company short staffed and two , me willing to change my plans would make me look good to the supervisor \( leaders have a way of remembering such small sacrifices when it comes to promotions , evaluation reports and raises \) i would do my project as soon as possible i believe in always being prepared and knowing that my boss has a habit of giving me tasks at the last minute , i 'd want to pace myself and get my project done and ready so i do n't have to be rushed \( which can lead to half baked work \) i would go because it shows our client that he she is valued and that we value their business showing up for even 5 minutes , no matter how tired , is better than not showing up it makes the company and by extension us look good in the client 's book \( which could mean more business with our company \) i would feel angry and irritated at first , i'm only human and negative feedback hurts then i would go to my manager and explain my side of things and point of view and see if we can find some middle ground regarding the situation if we ca n't find middle ground , i 'd just thank him her for the feedback and recommit to doing better i would actually find it enjoyable because i'm a people person and i love to talk i also love sharing my culture the good and bad with anyone willing to listen the same is true for my country any time i can brag about my country , i will so this client would be a good match for me
i would first talk to the other employee and find out what their plans are and compare those plans to mine i would evaluate each of our plans and see which is more realistic to change if my plans are more easily changed i would make the change , but if not i would speak with the supervisor and ask them to intervene i would make plans for possible future last minute tasks i would write down a plan and timeline to complete my project on time , but also allowing time each day to set aside for any additional tasks i may be assigned if i got too bogged down i would ask for help from other employees i would first try to convince my colleague to come with me and encourage them to participate and support me if they still refused to go , i would most likely attend anyway because of the client 's status i would do my best at the meeting to mingle and put my best self forward i would first take some time to reflect on my performance and evaluate whether or not the feedback was justified and if i were being to reactive if i still felt the feedback was inappropriate i would request a scheduled meeting with my supervisor and request the feedback be re evaluated and changed or to provide specific examples and how i could make improvements i would find this experience somewhat enjoyable i would like to learn more about the country and culture of the client , but i would feel bummed that i could not travel and learn first hand in the country i would make the best of it and try to imagine myself in the country and possibly learn something exciting that may make me consider personal travel to that location
i would be willing to give up my vacation time for my colleague i would do this since i will be owed a favor from that colleague in the future for this sacrifice i'm doing for him i would use that favor to help me advance my career i would try to complete as much of the project ahead of time as possible that would give me extra free time to tackle any last minute tasks my boss may give me it would require careful time management , but i am used to that i would bite the bullet and go to the networking meeting it is a good chance for me to make connections and advance my career while it is true i will be alone , i feel that i have good enough social skills to overcome that hurdle i would go to the manager and ask him to explain exactly why i got the feedback that i did if the explanation is still not satisfactory , i would start searching for other job opportunities it would be clear by then that future advancement for me will be limited if not completely closed off to me i would volunteer for this role i am someone that like to explore different cultures and customs it would be a fun exercise for me , really
i would change my vacation plans it would make me look better to my supervisor because i am able to be flexible it will also make my colleague indebted to me in the future i would finish the project as quickly as i could without sacrificing quality i would set completion benchmarks and goals to make sure it is finished early that way , if my boss gives me an additional task , i will not be scrambling between two projects i would explain to my colleague the importance of networking with this client i would convince them that going would be in their best interest i would tell them that i could do most of the networking , and they can just come for the experience i feel like i need to get a second opinion on the matter i think that if the second opinion is the same , then i need to adjust my performance in the end , i would have to make some kind of adaptation to make sure the next time i receive feedback it is positive i would find this experience enjoyable i think that learning about different countries and cultures can help you to understand people better it also makes you look at things from a different perspective from your own culture
i would just let my coworker has the vacation time since they are not willing to change their plans i figure that willing giving up my time would look good in my bosses eyes and they will think about me more when its time for a promotion i would go ahead and get the first project due out of the way that way , when my boss gives me a last minute task , i would already be finish with my project so i would n't have to rush i would want to give my best on all tasks so finishing early would let me give my best all around i would still go networking is all about meeting people , so even if i did n't know anybody when i got there , by the time i left i would plus it would look good to not only the clients but also my boss i would feel horrible getting negative feedback is never fun since it hurts to hear and this could mess with me getting a bonus , but it also might be something i need to hear i would take the feedback i got and try and do things different so my boss could see that i was at least trying to do better i would love to be able to learn new things about a culture that did n't involve me having to travel i would be taking on a project that could be good for not only me company , but also for me so that is a huge win win for me
i would first try and reason with the colleage agian and let them know that it is really important to me to take my vacation as apposed to them if they still dont budge i would talk to the manger and let them know why taking my vacation is more important then my colleague hoping that they would side with me i would do this because if i can get the manager on my side then i could possibly keep my vacation plans i would work overtime to make sure that the task got done early even though i would have a light work load because i know that my boss gives the other work that can take longer amounts of time i am able to prepare myself for additional work load i would do this because if i get my required work done early then if i am given extra tasks then i would have time to do them without having to worry about the required project i would encourage them to go because it would be a great networking opportunity not only for the both of us but for the company as well , showing our boss that we are invested in our company and it 's goals i would do this because there is power in numbers and it is better that there is more then one person from the company represented at the meeting and i would express that to my colleague as well i would also let them know that it would be nice to have someone else that i know there so i would have to go by myself , and it would put me at ease seeing a familiar face i would feel very frustrated with the situation because i dont agree with it and would want to figure out a way for my manager to see my point i would attempt to talk to the manager again to see if he she would change their mind if they still didnt change their mind i would go over their head and talk to whoever their boss is it might be a long shot but if there were consequences i would definitely try i would find this experience very enjoyable because it would expose me to different cultures and things that i am not accustomed to and i am sure that i would learn alot in the process it would also give me more experience and possibly open doors in the company because i am showing that i am willing to do what it takes to invest in the company and take on projects or responsibilities that others may not want to it would be fun to learn about norway to expand my knowledge without having to actually go there and i will be the only person who will have that knowledge and experience with the country
i would look at my plans to see if they can be adjusted if not i would go talk with my colleague and see if we can make some adjustments if we can work it out that will be great if not then the one who made the first request should have their request honored i would outline what i needed to do and have a draft ready i would submit draft to supervisor for review i would then adjust the draft with supervisor recommendations with the project completed this far hopefully i will be able to handle additional tasks i would go to the networking meeting it is not necessary to know anyone at these meetings the purpose of the meetings is to get to know new people i would use this as a great opportunity i would try to understand where the negative feedback originated i would be disappointed but i would try to learn why if possible i would try to correct the problem i would hope the feedback would be clear so i could see the solution i would find the project enjoyable it would be an opportunity to learn new things it would be a challenge to work with a different culture
i would change my week , as long as i had no pressing plans if i am taking vacation for a specific event , i would talk to my coworker and see if we could compromise but if i was just vacationing to relax , i would not care about changing my vacation i would make sure i have all my tasks lined up for my project , so that i could handle a last minute task if it comes my way i think that no matter what , i will probably be working on my project up until the last minute either way , i need to make it all work , even if i am overworked for the next two weeks i would go to the networking meeting anyway i ca n't expect to grow in my career if i do n't step outside of my comfort zone it might be better if my coworker does not go , so it forces me to network i would schedule a meeting with my manager , to expand on the issues a little more i think i should be able to tell my side of the issue , in hopes of it not affecting my bonus i think it is important to have a dialogue about something that will influence my payment i would find this very enjoyable even if i did not get to travel , it would be really fun to get immersed in another type of culture maybe if i worked hard enough , it would turn into a travel opportunity
if i could change my dates without too much trouble , i would do so it would show i am flexible i would do the project way in advance this would free me up for any last minute surprisesi would definately still go it is a work related function it would n't matter if i knew anyone or noti would write my manager a rebuttal with a copy to human resources meantime , i would put my resume out thereyes , it would be fun and beneficial to learn about norway it could come in handy for future endeavors
if i hadn t already booked my trip \( i usually travel on amtrak \) , i would be willing to change my dates but i would want to know from the supervisor , when my co worker put in her request for vacation if i put mine in sooner and had already made all my plans , i would probably tell her that my plans are complete and i put in my request before he she did and my co worker would have to change her dates i would work on the project in advance of the due date especially knowing that my boss often gives me last minute tasks i wouldn t want to stress myself out , trying to complete the project and being asked to do other tasks at the same time i would take advantage of my light workload , to begin to work on the upcoming project i would follow my co workers lead and not go i would make up some excuse as to why i wasn t able to attend i wouldn t want to go to the meeting , where i didn t know anyone i wouldn t feel too bad because i would know that my co worker was missing the meeting too i would ask my supervisor to explain in more detail , about the negative feedback i would explain to them how this negative feedback could have severe consequences for myself i would ask if , this were true , what i could do to improve myself or improve the situation i would do anything i could to not argue but to see if as constructive criticism , of which i could strive to do better i would find it interesting to volunteer to be involved in the project i don t like to travel but it would be fun to learn a little bit about norway , from the comfort of my own office i think it would be a unique experience and i always like to learn new things
i would change my vacation just so there wo n't be any conflict i rather be the bigger person , so there would n't be any hassle , i do n't need things at work or to make life more complicated that it already is i would try to get as much done as possible before the do date , so just in case my boss do decide to give me last minute task , i can have enough time to complete them all or trying working simultaneously on all task i would try my best to convince my colleague to go and if that fails , i will just go alone and try to get to know people and explain to them that we share a mutual friend and tell that my colleague could n't make it but , i'm filling in i would try to justify my actions and reasons if that does n't seem to work , then i will own responsibility and ask what i can do to improve and see it will change things in the future i would find this experience enjoyable , because i enjoying learning about new cultures and information about foreign places it will be very helpful in winning the client over and can be of great use in the future
it depends on if i have already purchased tickets if not , then i would change my vacation dates if i had already purchased them , i would explain that and explain that i value time with my family , especially since my kids are in school and i do not like to take them out of school for vacation if no resolution can be come by , i would threaten to quit i would make a time frame and work on the project each day until it is finished i would prefer to finish early since my boss may give me another project that i may need to work on quickly i dislike having half assed work i would still go i do n't need to know someone to have a good time also , meeting new contacts and maintaining a positive relationship with a client is more important i would explain my point of view however , if it is something i could change , i would change it to whatever my boss preferred i would feel upset and possibly report to my manager 's boss depending on the situation and how familiar i am with the boss i am an anthropologist learning about other cultures is part of what i do , it would be boring since i would n't be traveling to norway that would be disappointing
it depended on my plans if they are flexible , then i would be cool switching if i had something planned where i was going to be traveling , then i would be more concerned if my colleague did n't have to travel and i did , then i would approach them about the situation if they still would n't change , then i would go to the supervisor to see if they could do something i would finish the project i tend to get distracted and forget stuff , so it 's best to do it while it 's on my mind also , knowing that the boys might throw something else on at the last minute is also motivation to get it done asap if i was serious about my job , then i would go it would n't matter if they went because i should be looking out for myself it sounds like a great opportunity to meet someone who could benefit me and the company i would set up a meeting with my manager and talk about it if it 's something that i have evidence that i can support then i would bring that up if my colleagues know the way that i worked and can also support me , then i would probably ask one of them to speak on my behalf as well i'm always interested in learning new things learning about another culture or another country sounds very interesting to me i definitely think it 's something that i would find enjoyable and would have a good time researching
i would say we are both entitled to this time off i would compare stories with my colleague and if their need for that week was greater then mine or if i could change my plans i would take a different week off i would expect my workload to shoot up as the deadline approaches therefore i would have it finished days ahead of time since my workload is already light i would also not give the appearance that it is already finished and that i am busy working on it i would not go i have already put in a long day and my irritability would be high i figure i could do more harm then good by going with a bad attitude and if i dont know anyone there what good is going to come of it \? i would have it out with the manager i would want an explanation if nothing is said nothing is going to get better if i am valued this lowly by this manager and the situation doesnt change i would take my talents elsewhere i would volunteer cheerfully i have always been interested in that country and something very positive could come out of it if not winning points from upper management at least getting my foot in the door with the norwegian clients and at worst a good understanding of where i might want to go next vacation
i would probably cancel my plans someone has to give way , and the other person was not willing to do so i would not want to deal with the hassle of trying to push the other person into a different decision i would feel resentful toward them in the future i would attempt to plan my project around that possibility i would not want to miss the due date because i did not plan accordingly i would try and get the bulk of the project done early then i would do the finishing touches nearing the end of the timeframe , leaving myself time to do other unexpected assignments i would ask them to reconsider i 'd tell them that i hate going somewhere that i do n't know someone i am shy , and i would feel lost in such a situation i 'd probably beg if i had to i would feel frustrated i ca n't change what does n't seem to be a problem to me i would probably ask around , to see if others have noticed this thing i am doing wrong while i feel i am in the right , it is worth gathering more information and re evaluating this is especially true if the feedback could cost me , as noted that sounds incredibly enjoyable it 's fun to learn about new places , and i would be getting paid to for it i would look forward to the new information i would encounter
i would try to talk to my colleague first and see if they were possibly able to change their mind about not changing their plans if they still would n't change i would talk to my supervisor if i had more seniority if all else fails i mind end up having to change my plans i would get started on the project right away then if my boss was to give me some last minute projects i would have the time to complete everything there 's no need to wait until the last minute if you have 2 weeks it 's better to be prepared i would try to convince my colleague to go if they still did n't want to go i would go by myself i think someone should still go to the meeting and it will give me a chance to get to know everyone i would feel very bad about that situation i would talk to my manager to clarify the issue and see if they were given some misinformation i would not want to lose my annual bonus because of negative feedback i would definitely try to clear the situation up right away i would find it very enjoyable i like to learn about different cultures i find other cultures really interesting i love to travel so i would be hoping that there would be the possibility of travel involved in the project
i would probably just change my plans to another week as this does n't seem to be a winning battle if my colleague is truly that intransigent then arguing would only make me look petty i would just buckle down and make sure to show my skill set in their absence i would get to work on it right away and not procrastinate if my boss gave me some last minute tasks that would prevent me from handing in the project on time i would tell him her that i ca n't prioritize their new assignments until the project is completed this way everyone is on the same page with respect to expectations i would probably still go since networking is extremely important my colleague will probably get in trouble for not attending and i really do n't want that to be me i would see it as an opportunity to get ahead at the company and meet some new people as well i would feel really bad and dejected if i received that kind of feedback if i truly did n't believe it was true i would gather evidence at my desk to present to my manager i would show him her that i have met requirements and here is the proof that way they ca n't just gloss over my work and say it 's insufficient i would find this experience incredibly enjoyable as it 's always great to learn about new places and cultures even if travel to norway was n't involved i would still want to be a part of this project but travel there would only increase my interest i would make sure to put my best foot forward in this effort with our new client
i would try to find out why the colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans it would also depend upon why i asked for that particular week if either or both of us have a specific reason for needing that week off , i would try to work with the colleague to see if we can schedule vacation so that we can both attend our events if i was just taking a week for vacation , without any specific reason in mind , then i would probably be willing to take it a different week i would spend as much time on the project as i could , making sure the other work also gets done on time that way , the project would be done early then , if the boss gives me last minute tasks , i would have time to complete them i would go to the networking meeting if this is one of the largest clients , then they will be expecting someone to be there even if i wo n't know anyone there , i can put in an appearance and meet greet a few people once the client knows i have been there , then i can leave i would be upset about the situation i would check any logs or documentation i have that might relate to the feedback then i would approach my manager and ask to talk about the feedback i would try to be polite and ask for more information and what i can do to change the situation i would fine the experience enjoyable i have always been interested in norway as i have norwegian heritage my mother shared some norwegian culture when i was a child and it would be interesting to learn more about that i would also like to add to my knowledge of the culture
i would tell my colleague that i would be willing to move my vacation if he covered for me the next time i would secure a hard to get week later in the year like thanksgiving or christmas by making a deal if he agrees , i would consider it a win i would try and speed up my schedule to finish i would make sure that all of the difficult tasks were done sooner rather than later in case my boss assigns me more work i would be sure to finish all critical items by the end of the first week i would try and persuade them to go i would offer to go with them to their next meeting if that does n't work , i would offer to buy them dinner or concert tickets as an incentive i would be upset about the negative feedback i would ask for specifics so i could understand where he was coming from i would also ask if there was a way i could make up for it i would try to erase any bad marks before bonus time comes around i would find this experience enjoyable i have had no experience before with norway so i would find the chance to learn something new an exciting opportunity it would be fun for me learning about the culture of someplace new
i would probably take my vacation after the collegaue because i believe that i should put my work first before fun time im also somewhat of a workaholic so this would not bother me to much i would not express any anger or frustration about this situation instead i would try to work on the project to the best of my ability and try to get it done in a timely matter i would not attend if the colleague did not attend because i would feel some what out of place and i would get anxiety if i didnt know any one there i would feel somewhat concerned and curious about the situation i would also ask the manager to give me examples in were i engaged in those certain negative behaviors after that i would ask them to give me some constructive crticism about how to improve these behaviors so i could improve my work performance i would find it enjoyable because i would be learning about something completely new and interesting it would also keep me preoccupied for long hours so i wont get bored therefore i believe this would be a great experience
i would first try to convince my colleague to change his or her mind about the vacation what i would do if my colleague would not relent depends on whether or not i am senior to my colleague if am senior to my colleague , i would request management forcibly deny his or her vacation request if i am junior to the colleague , i would reschedule my vacation i would likely work on the project at home if possible and necessary to ensure i complete it on time and still be ready for additional tasking i am not doing during the evenings at home at this time of year anyway i pride myself on completing projects in a timely manner i would likely go to the meeting and introduce myself i would like to steal some business and favor from my colleague i would dread it , but would likely wind up enjoying myself if alcohol was part of the meeting , as with networking meetings sometimes are , i would probably have a little too much fun i would hunker down and try to give the boss what he or she wants i would also be thankful that what my boss defines as negative feedback , isnt my definition of negative feedback i generally administer some corporal punishment as a part of my negative feedback to subordinates i would find the experience enjoyable i would somehow try to manipulate the management to send me on a trip to norway on the company 's dime once i got there , i may seek asylum !
i would be forced to change my vacation days even though i would not be happy about it next year i would put i'm for it earlier and i probably would n't talk to that colleague for awhilei would ask my boss before the project due date if he had any other tasks that needed my attention i would stay busy but also make sure i have time for any last minute tasks and make sure i'm totally prepared for my project and it 's deadlines i would have to go to the network meeting because it 's important i would try to talk to my colleague into going if he wo n't i would still go to make myself look better to the client i would dispute the feedback i would try to find flaws in his thinking and maybe find proof of his errors if i did n't agree and felt he was acting unfairly i would go over his head i would find it interesting teaching some new things it would be fun learning a different culture i would take tours with them and learn things myself also
i would verify that my vacation plans and dates were able to be switched to another date if they could be changed , i would discuss with my spouse the need to make the changes and i would volunteer to take a different vacation time my reason for doing this would be that i would want to see everyone happy , regardless of the minor setback in the end , i would be hopeful that my colleague would remember this favor in the future should we have the problem in the future i would stay on top of my workload and not slack in case my boss adds extra unexpected work on me i would feel that is my responsibility this project and completing it would be a priority for me so i would work dilligentley to complete as soon as i could i would go to the meeting because it would be important for me to be there , to meet with the clients i would try to persuade my colleague to go with me it would not bother me that i did n't know anyone there i would be hopeful that my being there would help me in my relationship with the client i would address the negative feedback with my manager and try to figure out why we do n't see things the same if i were wrong then i would accept it and try to improve possibly we could find an error in his vision of things and straighten out the differences of opinion if not , i would look for a new job i would find learning new things about norway and their culture would be interesting it would be something new and if travel were to become necessary , i would welcome that as well i may be something to break up the normal routine of my normal job and i would enjoy that as well learning is never a bad thing definetley enjoyable
i would try and change my plans for the week if my colleague could n't do so maybe there was an important reason why she could n't take a different week if i could do it without any repercussions , i would change my week it 's not the end of the world i'm still getting a week vacation and would be thankful for that alone i would handle this project by completing as much of it as i could immediately after receiving it i would do this because of the potential to receive last minute tasks by my boss that would require huge chunks of my time therefore i would n't be rushing anything and could devote a sufficient amount of time to the project and any tasks i am given i would not go ! if they 're not going then why should i go \? i do n't like feeling like the odd one out , and without anyone else to lean on i would feel like i am out of place i would just make an excuse and not attend the meeting i would bring the feedback to my manager and ask them to explain further what i did wrong and how i can improve in the future i would also try to see if i could find a way around it and possibly have the feedback reversed or i would see if it could be reversed pending good behavior and no negative feedback in the future i would find the experience enjoyable because i love learning about other countries it would be fun to do something different and to learn from other people and about other cultures i would like to have the responsibility so i could show other workers and my boss that i am competent enough to fulfill the duties assigned to me
i would discuss this with my manager i would see if my manager could see if my co worker and i could come to an agreement if not , i would take my vacation time at another time i would get the work done right away that way i would have spare time if my boss gave me any last minute tasks , i would have time to do those tasks i would decide if i felt it was worth my time if it was , then i would go if not , then i would choose not to go i would discuss my concerns with my manager i would explain why i dont agree with their feedback i would explain why i feel they are wrong and would prove that i am doing my job right i would find this boring i like to travel by my choice and to destinations of my choosing i would not want to have to learn new things unless it was something i was interested in
i would likely change my vacation plans i would do this because it would make me look good in the eyes of my boss it would also give me some sway over the other coworker so it is a win win for me i would start attacking the project right away i am a big believer of getting things done early assuming i could get this project done early , i would then have free time or be able to handle any other project i would definitely go to the meeting no matter what if my colleague does go then i will no someone and that will make it more comfortable if they do not go then i would get one on one time with a very important client which could be very valuable i would feel bad and i would try to talk to my boss and get a better understanding of why he felt this way i think if i talked to him , i could either convince him why he was wrong or figure out what i needed to change i think it would be very important to find out exactly how i could improve in the future i would definitely find it enjoyable i am fan of learning about other cultures and think this would be a good opportunity to do that i also like that there is a chance that i could get to travel there and that would make it more fun
i would determine if i could change my travel arrangements for a different week if so , i would concede and change my plans if i could n't change my plans , and my colleague would n't change their plans , i would leave the final decision up to our supervisor i would compensate for the potential extra tasks my boss sometimes gives by front loading my schedule with tasks related to completing the project this would allow me to complete more of the project related work sooner and accommodate any last minute tasks my boss decided to assign if i was at or near the final deadline , i would request that my boss prioritize the new work against the project work i would attend the meeting , if my personal scheduled allowed for it acting as the face of the company would be good for my career and also provide opportunities to network with others in the industry the fact that i would n't know anyone would not discourage me from attending i would ask my manager to provide clear proof to support the negative feedback failing to provide that proof would indicate a failure on their part to clearly document a situation that has both financial and moral related consequences i would also request that the human resources department be involved in any future discussions on the issue i would gladly welcome a new opportunity to help the organization with a new client additionally , i would enjoy learning about a country and culture unfamiliar to me the ability to participate in the project without the travel requirement would make involvement less stressful
firstly , i would ask my colleague to try changing his vacation week if the colleague agreed then i would be happy and tell him her that i would help the next time he she needs something if not agreed then i would postpone my vacation and tell my colleague that i am postponing my vacation for him her and he she owes me i would start working on the project immediately , to refrain any last minute stress or mistakes this way i would have enough time to complete the project efficiently and even if my boss gives me extra last minute tasks , i would be prepared to complete them without any problems i would go even if my colleague is not coming because these kind of meetings are important to climb up the ladder in my career and even if my colleague is not coming and i do n't know anyone there because , i would think of this as an opportunity to meet and talk with new people and learn new things since it is with one of our largest clients i would feel worried because it is likely that it is not true i would discuss the feedback with my boss and clarify if there is any misunderstanding i would request him her to review the work again so that they can have a final decision i would surely volunteer because i like exploring new places , new things , cultures , traditions i would love to take the opportunity because if there is a chance to do something i love in a way that makes it work related , that would be fun
i would talk to my colleague to see if he has reservations if not i would try to have him change his vacation since you requested it off first if he she wo n't change their vacation i would change mine but not be happy about it i would remind my boss that i am working on this project i would ask my supervisor if they have any other projects for me to work on well in advance of the due date i would explain that i would like enough time to complete any projects well and would appreciate the time to do them correctlyi would go anyway networking is a good way to advance my career it would look good to the client if i go i can introduce myself to people i would talk to my manager first and get some more details for why he gave me the feedback i would then explain why i do not agree with it , if we ca n't come to a consensus i would then go to human resources to try to get this solved i would find this experience enjoyable as i am curious about other countries and cultures i would do the best job possible so i can get similar assignments in other countries maybe i could travel to some of the countries on business
i would change my vacation plans i would reschedule my vacation a week or two after he came back i would ask him to let me know when he is planning on taking a vacation in order to avoid any future conflicts i would also let him in on my vacation plans i would get the project completed as quickly as possible that way i can handle anything that might come up i could also handle any modifications to the project there always seems to be last minute changes or additions to a project i would talk to him and explain the importance of the meeting i would possibly take on some of his tasks as payment i would also offer one of my vacation days if i thoght it was that important i would feel badly about this situation i would ask him to document the specifics in an email the email would provide proof of the negative feedback and why it may be incorrect i would probably not volunteer since i probably have enough to manage it would probably be extra work with little reward i am not interested in learning about other cultures
i would change my vacation week i would do so because i 'd want to be a team player however i would make a point with my colleague and supervisor that i want credit for being accommodating now should i need some flexibility for time off in the future i would focus on getting the project done knowing of my boss' penchant for giving me last minute tasks , i would ask a co worker for assistance in case i am assigned a task like that i would be happy to give the co worker credit for their help i would try to encourage my co worker to come , perhaps negotiating with them regarding how long we would stay at the meeting or enticing them by offering to buy them dinner after should my colleague still decline to come , i would go myself i would do so because i would n't want to disappoint the client and because there could be an opportunity for me at the meeting to advance by leaving a good impression i would feel terrible and angry about the situation i would try to approach my manager 's boss to discuss the situation with them i would want to be able to defend myself against the potential loss of my bonus i would find the experience enjoyable because i am curious about other countries and cultures i would also want to enjoy the task because it would leave a good impression with the management at work knowing more things would also make me a better and more valued worker in general
i would not give up my vacation for someone else , because i worked hard , too i have important hings to do i don t mind negotiating or flipping a coin , however i would certainly fight it i would get everything out of the way just in case of last minute projects i would begin it right away , work fast , maybe grade b work too much effort means a late project , unfortunately i would go anyway i don t want to look bad , either i need to be able to do my job well i would ask my colleauge if they may change their mind i would go right to my manager and ask what went wrong i tried my best , dammit did i mot understand a project or something \? please let me try again i would just try harder , i guess i would like to study about norway i would work on textbooks , read articles online , anything i would study the language and find it enjoyable it means helping the company out and possibly future clients from norway
i would also fight to go on my vacation and see what the supervisor did i dont feel as though i should have to change my dates just because my colleague does n't want to give up their dates most of the time i plan around my boyfriends availability so i would n't want to change my dates either i would try to finish as much of the project as i could before the very end dates to save time for last minute tasks this would prevent me the stress of having to do everything as once i am also very focused and goal oriented so i believe i 'd have the ability to finish the tasks at the end especially if i finished most of it beforehand i would attend the networking meeting because it 's a good opportunity to look good to my company i also like meeting new people so not knowing anyone is not a big concern i would look at it as an opportunity to further my own career i would go to someone above the manager to let them know i did n't agree with the feedback sometimes i believe people take personal issues and add them into work issues which is wrong i would n't want to lose something i gained from false feedback i would find this experience enjoyable i really like learning about new places and cultures and i would even love to travel to norway i think you gain an understanding of everyone in the world better when you learn about all cultures
i would let my colleague take the week vacation i feel that it would bring good karma to me and maybe he had more things planned than myself i think it is always a good idea to do good things for others i would hope he would repay the favor if it would to come of that i would finish the project early this is in case my boss gives me last minute projects i would not wan to take on more than i can handle i believe that this would be the best option for me and having the project be done on time i would go without my colleague things like this do n't happen very often and it would be a great way to network it is very important to show you are trustworthy and can get the job done i would feel upset that my manager felt this way i would really look into the negative things he said and see if there was something i was missing i would work on those things to improve them for next time i do n't think he was doing it on purpose i would find this extremely enjoyable just because i wo n't be visiting does n't mean i would not learn anything of greatness from that country i would love to learn more and to show the client that we , as a company care i feel that this would be pleasant and would give me a great excuse to get out of my comfort zone
i would change my vacation plans for this time period and put my vacation request earlier for my next desired vacation so that i would get it i would also tell my colleague that i would let him know what my next week would be so we could plan different weeks i would do this because i think it would be fair i would go ahead and complete the project given to me early because i had the time available this way i would be prepared for any last minutes assignments or other scenarios that might present themselves and need attention i would do this because it is the efficient thing to do , and i would be prepared if i procrastinated for no reason and then was inefficient it would be my fault i would go with or without my colleague i would try to talk him into it but i would go regardless networking is a major component of success people help other people and work as teams i would network because it is the right thing to do to achieve goals i of course feel tense and nervous i would ask my boss questions about why he gave the feedback he did i would do this because in order for me to truly change my behavior , i must understand why he feels the way he feels my boss probably wants me to be successful , and if i can understand his motivation , i can either change , or at least come to a compromise that suits us both i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about other cultures i find it is both pleasurable , and it brings a deeper understanding of humanity the more you learn , the more connections you make across topics , and the better you understand people this helps you make better decisions
unless i had tickets that i could n't change i would just take my vacation another week it 's not worth the hassle of fighting about it next time something like this happens my manager will remember that i took one for the team i would make finishing up this task as early as possible a priority knowing my boss gives me last minute tasks it would be imprudent to wait to finish this any longer than necessary i would get right on it i would go to the meeting there will be at least one other person there who does n't know anybody else it will be a good opportunity for me to shine on my own i would take time to appraise the feedback carefully i would look for anything that might have resulted in my manager misunderstanding or misinterpreting some aspect of my performance i would also note where it was correct i would write out some bullet points and bring it up to my manager in a non confrontational manner stating that i simply wanted to fully understand so i could improve i would ask for his advice as to how to correct things i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i love learning about the country and culture of others i would love it more if it did require some travel i would learn a lot of new things about the world , and myself , in the process and probably meet some really neat people
i would approach my colleague , find out his plans , compare them to mine and see which ones could be more easily adapted if i am planning on actually going somewhere and have made the arrangements and bought the tickets , or paid for the hotels , i would n't be able to switch so easily i might even hve to have a discussion with my supervisor and let him know when i applied for the time in relation to my coworker and the plans i have made since my workload is light at the moment i would start on it immediately i might even take sometime when i am at home to get a general outline of what i am supposed to be doing each day if my boss does approach me i would let him know of the approaching deadline and how much work i have left i would try to convince my coworker towards going i would let him know that part of our work related duties is to network and to attend meetings even while tired i would give him the benefits of going versus not i might approach my manager and ask if we could set aside some time for a meeting between the two of us to discuss the feedback during that time , i would give him my viewpoints and ask for his this way we can have an open honest discussion and hopefully come to an agreement i would probably enjoy it , although i am not positive i do not know much about norway but then again that might be one of the perks , that i have to learn more about it it might look good in the eyes of my company to take on the added responsibility so that may weigh my decision as well
i would try to coordinate , collaborate and compromise with my colleague if there plans are fixed and unable to change , i would speak to my boss about either changing my dates or perhaps getting someone from another location or office to cover my work i would do my best to complete the project as soon as possible given the facts noted above , this is the only viable option , as i have no idea what additional work may be thrown my way , or the timeframe in which to complete i do not like to procrastinate i would see how i was feeling if i was in the mood i would attend , networking is always a postive as far as i am concerned i would not let my colleagues actions affect my attendence i would confront my manager with facts seeing as i do not believe this to be true and the horrid consequences depicted above , i would plead my case for exoneration from this feedback i would probably find it enjoyable first i would learn of another culture and second i would be assisting the company for the good this seem like a win win situation as far as i am concerned
i think our boss should weigh in on this decision it might also be a good idea to just flip a coin or maybe total up each of our hours worked and whoever put in more hours gets to take the vacation time they want i would definitely finish them project as quickly and efficiently as possible in order to free up time for last minute projects that my boss might give to me i would feel obligated to go because it s an opportunity to get a leg up at my job it s one of our largest clients and that s a big deal at our workplace we rely on clients , especially the big clients i would definitely ask my manger to have a talk with me i would present my argument about the feedback and why i believe it isn t true i would be firm but respectful i think this would be very interesting ! i would also hope i got the opportunity to travel to norway ! always a good idea to know personal things about clients !
i would just choose to take my vacation another time it would not be worth the hassle to try and convince my colleague i would just let them have the vacation time i would finish it as quick as i could i would do that because i might get more work later on i would try to be prepared for whatever comes my way i would still go to the meeting it sounds like an important place to be i would make the best of not knowing anyone and meet new people i would probably keep it to myself i would not risk losing the bonus i would talk about it with my co workers i would find it enjoyable because it is a new country that i do n't know much about i think it would be interesting to learn new things i would also think that it is good that i do n't have to travel there
i would be more than happy to change my vacation time i'm very flexible and we are a good team i would also like to be seen by my manager as being a team player i would make sure i would finish the project i would work over for free it is important to me to please my boss 8n the long run it will be worth it i would find someone else to go with me if i had to go alone i would but would not like it or , i would bribe my colleague to come with me by offering to buy dinner i would ask my manager to provide details if the claim is wrong , i would defend myself i would tell my manager i disagree i would find this experience enjoyable i love learning about other cultures i would be eager to have this role
i would try to request my vacation at another time i have had that happen to me once and i was fine with changing my days i usually like to be flexible and understanding with my coworkers i would try to find time do get done the things needed for the project as well as the last minutes tasks that my boss has given me i would definetly work on both things i would dedicate my day by spreading out both tasks during the day i would dedicate few hours to each everyday i would not go either since , there won t be anyone i know , i wouldn t feel like going i would not feel comfortable in that scenarioi would feel devastated anyone in that position would i would try to talk to the manager and tell him her about how i feel perhaps i ll tell the manager to reconsider after all , we are all humans and can make mistakes i would find it boring in order to learn about a new place , there is nothing better than visiting the place and experiencing their culture i would have preferred traveling more
i would attempt to plead my case to my colleague and supervisor i would be prepared to concede the vacation week if it really is n't possible for my colleague to do so , and the workplace would really be too understaffed i would start as early as possible so as to lower the chance they throw a curve ball at me towards the end i would also ask them if there 's anything else they would like me to do , before even starting i would immediately remind them of that fact if convincing them fails , i 'd at least ask them for a message or greeting to start conversations at the meeting with i would still go to the meeting under any circumstances i would regrettably , and silently comply to the best of my ability i would realistically vent to a colleague about the events losing my bonus is worse than my pridei would most likely dislike the feeling of 'forced worldliness' , especially if it involves the difficult task of learning norwegian other than that i think i 'd enjoy , and even volunteer for the assignment
i would ask my boss who requested the time off first if we both requested it at the same time , the person who has seniority over the other should be allowed to take it , otherwise whoever asked for it first i think this should also be the policy going forward i would get started right away to make sure its done on time i would set goals and deadlines in order to organize my work and not burn myself out if my boss gives me too much work before this project is done i would tell him i need to focus on this first i would try to convince him to come with me telling him how it could be a good opportunity for us i would tell him we should at least give a try and if it is n't to our liking we can just go home early if he still does n't want to come i would go by myself i would ask to speak to my manager in private i would explain that i do not agree with his feedback and ask him to be specific if what he says makes sense to me i would promise to work on it and do better i would find it very enjoyable i love learning things from other cultures i would read up on their customs and try authentic foods it would be a lot of fun to be a part if this project
i would find out another schedule and time for my vacation if my boss was willing to accommodate the new vacation plans i would be very thankful it would not bother me that my co worker was able to take a vacation before my either i would first make a list of all urgent things to do on my agenda , including the project as well as ordinary duties then i would relay this information to my boss so that we are on the same page lastly , i would make sure to check in with my boss daily to go over progress towards the project i would go to the meeting without my colleague and get to know other people by introducing myself to new people i would also find out if any of my other colleagues were planning on attending the meeting finally , i would contact my client go get an idea of what specific topics the meeting would be about i would voice my concerns with my manager and tell his or her that i don t agree with the feedback then i would ask my colleagues for advice finally , i would find out ways to avoid any consequences by going through company channels with other managers i would find this experience very enjoyable as i love learning about different cultures spending some time online doing research would provide me with the information needed to connect with the client and norwegian culture it would be very fun to learn about the history of the country , foods , and cultural events
i 'd just take a different week off for my vacation i 'd probably stay home for my vacation anyway so it 's not a big deal but i 'd make sure that colleague knows he owes me a favor i 'd keep working on the project in my free time if my boss gives me last minute work i 'd do that first then go back to the project when i'm free again i definitely would n't wait until the last minute to do the project i 'd probably still go the purpose of a networking meeting is to meet new people and network so if there 's nobody there that i know that 's just more opportunities to network if i'm really tired i 'd consider skipping it too but i 'd lean towards going still i 'd approach my boss and tell him why i did what i did and why i think his negative feedback is wrong if it leads to me losing a bonus or something i 'd take it up with hr i 'd do everything i can respectfully to make sure there are no negative consequences i would n't mind learning about norway as long as i'm getting paid and get to do the research at work i 'd be happy to spend some time learning about norway if they asked me to do it at home without pay i would n't do it
i would talk to my colleague and see if they were willing to change the vacation date because i really need to have this week off if the colleague was not willing to change it i would go talk to my boss i would explain to my boss that i would still like to have the week off i requested but if it is not possible than i will take the week after i would do this like this because i think it would make it easier and i would not want to start a workplace conflict over a vacation weeki would continue to work on the project that was due if another task came up and i thought that i could complete it in a timely manner without affecting my primary task i would work on it i would strive to complete my primary task as stated i would talk to my colleague and try to talk them into going with me i would tell them this would be a great opportunity to network with other people if my colleague still decided not to go i would go anyways i would go because i feel like this is an opportunity to network and meet new people and i would not want to miss out of that opportunity i would feel upset about the negative feedback i would approach my boss and ask him her why i was given negative feedback and how i thought it was inaccurate i would let my boss know that i do n't want this to effect my work i would ask if it was possible that he she did not give the right feedback i would find this experience enjoyable i feel like learning about another country and culture would be fun i think knowing more about a country would widen my knowledge about things and would be better for me i am always interested in learning new things and i just think this would be fun
i would first try to ascertain which of the two of us requested leave first if my colleague did , i would give up my claim on the date if i did , i would address to my supervisor the fact that i requested leave first for that date , and should therefore be given priority if i was unable to ascertain who had made the request first , or we had both made the request at the same time , i would request that the supervisor use some unbiased means \( perhaps a coin flip \) to determine who got to take their vacation and who had to reschedule ultimately it is the supervisor 's responsibility to deal with conflicts like thus , if there is no obviously right or wrong party i would communicate my schedule and availability to my boss , letting her know my concerns about possibly having unexpected tasks added to my workload which might prevent meeting my deadline i would then proceed to work on my deliverable per my schedule if my boss adds additional tasks to my workload , i would candidly discuss how these additional tasks might affect my ability to meet my deadline , and make sure to get , in writing , a statement from her indicating her understanding of these consequences in the event of a slipped or missed deadline , i would then have documentation i would try to encourage my colleague to go , citing the importance of maintaining good client relations if my colleague decided not to attend , i would attend anyway , since it is important that somebody represent the company the point of a networking event is to meet new people , so the fact that i otherwise would not know anyone should not be relevant i might , however , plan to make a short evening of it , particularly if the event proved uninteresting or unfruitful i would request a meeting with my supervisor to further duscuss the feedback at the meeting , i would calmluly explain my own point of view , and explain why i feel her feedback was inaccurate i will go in prepared , if possible , with documentation to support my case i will , however , be prepared to listen to my supervisor 's point of view and any supporting documentation that she might provide i would find this experience fascinating and would definitely volunteer for it learning about new cultures is always something that i have enjoyed , and this would provide me with an opportunity to learn about one to which i have not had much exposure i cannot understand why any person would turn down this opportunity , even if it comes with no additional remuneration
i would try to work out a compromise with the other employee first , to see if we could both take part of the week off if this did not work out , i would try to change my plans and work this week to accommodate the other person however , if i gave up my vacation , i would inform my manager so they know that i was being a good teammate i would use my free time to start on the project early i would complete as much of the project as i could ahead of time this way , i could accomodate any unexpected requests from my manager doing this would also give me leeway in the future to avoid rushing as the deadline approaches i would choose not to go to the networking event i do not enjoy these types of activities , so i would not be interested to confirm my decision , not knowing anyone would make me even less likely to attend if my colleague does not go , i would feel it is more acceptable for me to skip as well i would politely ask my manager to elaborate on their statements i would use this as a chance to share my own insights in a positive way my hope would be that i could explain my side without being forceful and eventually soften their position on the topic i would find this experience somewhat boring i would expect that i would have to spend quite a bit of time teaching and advising them , which would detract from my own work i prefer to complete tasks on my own , so this would be more of a burden for me
i would graciously give up my vacation time my vacation is n't worth more than looking like a team player at least not to me personally if i have a vacation i ca n't easily replace in time such as visiting a favorite aunt before she croaks then i will explain why it is important and hold my ground if i am told to give it up by higher authority at that point then i will be serious and let it show that something else must be given for me to concede maybe more time off or lesser duties so i can tend to what i needed the vacation time for from afar i would be upfront and tell him how my workload is relatively light to prompt him to tell me of any other tasks at that point so i can get started on them i would prompt him a few times in different ways in hopes he tells me soon what he might be asking for later if i can not steer him away from dropping things on me belatedly then i will throw out a time frame on how long each new task will take so he she knows how what he is doing is actually affecting me for example my boss , i need you to do xyz also me , okay , i can start on x this afternoon , i will have to break for the first part of the project and then should be able to start y tomorrow morning that way he can hear how i am having to manage things in other words , i will try to break him of this habit i would explain how it is to both of our benefits to go to this meeting i would suggest he only stay a short time if he prefers and that that would be sufficient not only to make an impression but to help me settle in i will promise to tell him what all was said and done for the rest of the evening that might benefit him i ask to speak to him her and ask what they are basing my evaluation on so we can see if we are dealing with the same facts concerning my evaluation i feel angry because i do n't believe it is true but hold that emotion in because i ca n't persuade them of anything such as changing my feedback if i show that if i ca n't show them how the feedback is inaccurate then i have no choice but to let it go keeping in mind i have to observe and find out why the feedback is inaccurate did someone sabotage me , is my manager covering for someone and i was unaware of some political maneuverings going on in the office \? or , i have to admit the feedback is accurate and change how i am doing things i would find it interesting because i like learning about other countries and cultures i would find it irresistibly interesting if it means i get something out of volunteering later say for instance a harder look come promotion time or raise time
i would speak to my supervisor to see who requested the vacation first if it was my colleague , then i would agree to change my week if it was me who requested it first , i would tell my supervisor that it 's only fair that my colleague change his request i would try to get the project done as soon as possible this way i will have time to complete any last tasks that i may be given if i am not given any more tasks , then i will just have more free time toward the end i would try to persuade my colleague to go i would say that i am also tired , but this is an opportunity that we should not miss if i ca n't convince him , i would go by my self i would respectfully tell my manager that i do n't understand where the negative feedback is coming from i would try to get more information and politely tell him her that i disagree if my manager is immutable on the topic , then i would leave it at that and try to speak to my manager 's superior i would find this experience slightly enjoyable i would like to learn more about norway , but it would seem kind of pointless if it does n't actually involve traveling to the country i would much prefer to travel there
it would depend on who put in the request for time off first first come , first serve it would also depend on why my colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans if it was for something like a birthday , anniversary , wedding , or funeral that ca n't be changed , i 'd just request the week before or the week after if my colleague was being stubborn , and i had put in the request first , i 'd put in my two weeks' notice and start farming out my resume i would take care of my assigned project first the light workload would give me an opportunity to finish that task on schedule , if not actually ahead of schedule , and better than if i were under a lot of pressure this way , if my boss decided to spring a last minute trap on me , i 'd have plenty of time to give those my full time and attention without worrying about the original project honestly , though , i would n't work for someone like that they 're usually toxic i also would n't let my boss know i finished the first assigned project ahead of schedule just so they would n't load extra crap on me i would go anyway if my colleague wants to stay home , that 's on them i think going would be worthwhile so i wo n't know anyone there big deal this is what introductions and the 30 second elevator speeches are for besides , i can size up the client and make my own decisions a lot more easily if i do n't have anyone interfering and i could also bag additional clients that my colleagues basically skipped out on more sales and commissions for me ! i would talk to my boss about the negative feedback i want to know exactly where they think i screwed up and want to know how to correct it if i can if i lost my annual bonus because of it , i 'd walk and find another job clearly i would n't be that valuable to them , and if they wanted me to stay , they 'd need to guarantee my bonus and help me correct what i did wrong , if anything there 's no point in getting angry about it , though i 'd probably be internally seething i 'd think it would be fun ! i have friends in scandinavia and learning about other cultures is enjoyable it 'd be a fun project and a way to kill the tedium at work who knows \? i might pick up some transferable skills , too
first i would discuss with my colleague regarding the reasons for our vacations and determine their priority i would then ask if there are any fixed costs that are already tied to his plan at those dates after deliberating , if his situation is more serious , i would be willing to concede , but not otherwise if my current workload is easily manageable , i would ask my boss if there are any tasks he would usually give me last minute that i could help on in advanced so that i would not be caught unaware if this is not an option , i would simply try to finish up as much as i could otherwise , i do n't believe there is much i can do at that date i would first ask my colleague how willing he would be to go and if there is anything that would change his mind if he still does n't want to attend , i am happy to go alone and meet knew people it is always nice to meet knew people and socialize i would initially feel a bit negative i would then try to see why the manager would feel such a way from his perspective if i still have trouble understanding his reasoning , i would ask for his time to talk to him and communicate my confusion , clarify my shortcomings , thank him for his advice , and try to do better going forward if the feedback is negative just cause he felt like it , there is n't much i can do i would find it enjoyable it is always a pleasant experience to learn something new about different countries and cultures furthermore , i would personally prefer perhaps visiting for a bit
i would change my plans it seems to be better to be cohesive with a co worker i presume their plans are not easily changeable i think that i would be unhappy with the task i would , however , do it without grumbling i have a job and if i do n't like it i can leave i would probably go after all , it 's involving the large clients i might not care about not knowing anyone i would try to appeal it to the next level if you do n't believe it 's true and has negative implications , i do n't think i would just let it go i would like to learn about norway i think that i would find the experience enjoyable because i love to travel i know that travel is not a necessity but it 's what i would do
i would say fine whatever i do n't have time to play little games with petty people i 'll be the bigger person and change mine because if you argue this with her , after her saying she was sticking to her guns she is going to make your life living hell the whole time you work together make sure i have plenty of time allocated to this taste for that very reason if you go ahead account the time , \( usually an hour or two \) then you may be safe ! i would profusely beg them , offer to buy them a beer or a pretzel if they just go with me this one time i would then drag out the old remember when i line and then really stress how this is our largest client and how important it is we attend that meeting ! i do n't like it one bit and will fight it i will find the proof that i am correct i keep a big book with our quality work in it , so we know if we are doing it correctly i would not think twice about telling my supervisor they are wrong and argue that point but only if i know for a fact i am right i would find it very interesting my kids are grown and on their own , so it 's like i have all the time in the world to learn something new even if i did n't get to travel , i would still learn something there is a whole world out there and we need to embrace it
i would probably agree to go at a different time i am an empty nester at this point , so i do n't have to worry about kids , etc so , my vacation plans are variable knowing my boss might add last minute tasks , i would make my own deadline for the project a few days earlier that way , i build in time to allow for extra projects that might come up i would go anyway if my colleague does n't go , it means i will be forced to make new acquaintances that might be beneficial for my job never miss an opportunity to network ! i would give myself a couple of days to think about the feedback , so that i can distance myself from the emotion of the negative feedback then , if i still do n't agree with the manager , i would ask for a private meeting to discuss it , providing evidence for why i think it is wrong i also would be careful to document everything i think it would interesting to learn a few things about norway and its culture and while i would not necessarily need to travel , perhaps there is the potential of visiting norway at the company 's expense plus , it 's an opportunity that could lead to something better
i would ask my supervisor who receives priority over the vacation if i requested first , then i will continue to argue that i should receive the vacation if my co worker requested first , then i would gladly give up my spot but try to encourage him her to give up the next spot it 's like the co worker would owe me rather than spread out my workload across the two weeks , i would get all of my work done early and continue to follow up with my boss i would also request that my boss keep me updated on certain things and that he she would not annoy me by doing so if my boss does n't end up having extra work , then i can enjoy the extra time to myself i would n't go unless i'm getting paid if i get paid , then i will attend the networking event as it is a great opportunity to get my name out there and to promote my business if i'm not paid , then i will not go because i will be extremely uncomfortable and it would not be worth it to go by myself though upset , i need to understand that this is criticism since i truly feel that it is n't true , i would have a meeting with my boss and see if he she would allow me to plead my case if my boss does n't agree , then i will accept that i may not receive an annual bonus however , if he does agree , then i will continue to improve and ask if he can give me feedback before it affects me financially i would find the experience enjoyable i personally like to learn about different cultures and can actually appreciate other cultures as i do empathize with foreigners it would also be a way to broaden my horizons which would be great for personal growth
i would try to change my vacation , if not then she can change hers one of them would be easier to change than the other i would try to do it as fast as i could i would try to stay late some days or come in earlier i think then i would get it completed on time i would try to persuade them to still come if that does not work , then i would suck it up and go i would just try not to stay late make an appearance and then leave if i knew for sure they were wrong , then i would try to prove myself as best as i could if they do not believe me still , then its okay that i will not get the bonus i know i was right in my heart and god knows and it will somehow come back to me i think i would find it enjoyable it sounds very interesting i would also like to travel if i could , if it were paid for
i would try to have a polite discussion with my colleague and discern the reason why s he is unwilling to move their vacation to a different week if they have a valid reason or seem extremely unwilling , then i would be happy to adjust and move to a different week myself i would try to see the bigger picture i would make sure i devoted enough time and attention to the project so that it was finished ahead of time i would also try and find out from my boss beforehand if there is any possibility they could let me know about last minute tasks so that i am not overburdened when it is crunch time i would explain that it would be good to know about last minute tasks ahead of time i would have a discussion with my colleague and explain that it would be an advantage for me if they came along , as i do not know anyone there i would explain how it would be good for the company to have someone familiar with the other people so we can network together i would hope my colleague will be understanding of the situation and change their mind about not going i would of course be very disappointed about it but i would also try not to let it get me down too much i would try to take it in my stride , move on and let my work speak for itself i would find the experience really fun and interesting that 's because i love learning more about other cultures and countries of course i would n't be travelling in this job , but the fact that i would still get to learn about norwegian culture and way of life etc is an incentive motivation for me
i would let my colleague take his vacation first and then would choose a different week i then would hope that the manager would notice the fact that i am more flexible besides i would not be bothered to delay my vacation while i would be helpful at work i would get on the job immediately to make sure i will be done in time whenever i get last minute tasks from my boss i would try to squeeze them while i complete my project i do not like postponing projects to the last minute i would lean towards going to the event i would feel that it is important to keep a positive relationship since it is one of the large clients as for the fact that i would be there alone and not know anyone there i would try to do my best and make good contact with them i would more than likely feel really bad about it and would feel like have to do something about it i would at least try to find out the reason for the negative feedback if still not convinced i would talk to my manager if there would be anything i could do to make things better i would absolutely like to volunteer on the project i would believe that it would be a great opportunity to learn something new about an interesting culture it would be very exciting interacting with people coming from a different culture i would not mind traveling either
the answer to this question depends upon what i had planned for that particular week in most cases , i would simply change my plans if my plans also included many other people who had made plans for that same event i would argue my case with my boss and allow my co worker to do the same then my employer could make and informed decision about that week of vacation i would go ahead and complete this project as soon as possible this would give me extra time in case some unexpected problem came up with the project it would also give me time to relax if nothing else comes up , or to complete any extra tasks assigned to me at the last minute networking is very important to my career my colleague chose not to go his loss is my gain i will go and do my best to meet and get to know new clients after all , i'm not going to the meeting to fellowship with my personal friends , but with my clients knowing me , the first thing i would do is to get angry then i would calm down and examine what he had to say if there is any truth to what he said , then i need to work on those issues if not then he must have a personal problem with me i need to take a witness with me and ask him what that problem is and how i can fix it this would really be fun for me i love to learn about the history and culture of other countries and people it helps me to understand them better i would do some preliminary research and then volunteer for this position
i would try to find out who made the request for vacation first if my colleague made their request first , i would honor that and choose a different week if i made my request first , i would present this information to our supervisor to enforce a fair policy i would plan to take care of my project first by doing more work early on in case something came up knowing that i am sometimes delegated tasks last minute , i would prioritize my project now to allow room for other tasks towards the end of the time period by following this approach to my time management , i would make sure to finish my project before the deadline while also juggling any tasks given to me i would try to encourage my colleague to attend the meeting for the benefit of our company and client if they were unwilling to go , i would muster up some confidence to mingle with this group by myself i would enjoy the challenge of helping the networking meeting to be a success by myself i would try to understand my manager 's point of view and where the negative feedback was coming from i would try to ask lots of questions to help get to the bottom of the situation i would try to adjust my behavior and performance based on the feedback so that i could avoid consequences i would find the experience of learning about a new culture very exciting i would be happy to volunteer for this project as it would not only help to show my initiative to my company , it would help expand my world view i would be gaining personal development while helping my company , it 's a win win
i would concede the vacation to the other employee i ca n't imagine anything i would have wanted to do that could n't wait i would expect to be relieved for my vacation time as soon as the other employee returned from his vacation i would try to have my project done early if the boss is going to surprise me with an added task , i will be ready i can work around a boss like that i would first try to convince my colleague to go if he declines , i 'll check with the boss to see if i should go alone if the boss is good with it , i 'll go alone and do my job i would not be happy about the negative feedback if it was justified , i 'd take it and move on if it was not justified , i 'd make the manager justify it , whatever the consequences i would find the experience enjoyable i'm good with all kinds of people and willing to learn new cultural ways i might worry about mistakes but not enough not to try it
i would evaluate whether or not my vacation plans were negotiable if they were , i would have to change them if the plans were non negotiable , i would make my supervisor aware of the situation first if my supervisor was unable to provide any assistance , i would likely try to negotiate with my fellow worker in the event that my fellow worker was not able to be compelled to change their mind , i would leave the situation to the supervisor to decide which one of us would get the time off i would work diligently on the project now to ensure that it is 'mostly' done although the task may not be complete , i would make sure that it could be completed fairly quickly if left in a crunch for time therefore if my boss were to throw in some last minute tasks , i would n't feel so overwhelmed i would go to the networking meeting anyway it is important to put your feelings aside in order to achieve a goal whether i know anyone at the meeting or not does not matter i would put my best face forward and make myself desirable for interaction with others i would apologize to my manager for any negative concerns that they have and ask for recommendations on how to improve my performance on the job next , i would begin to keep diligent records of my performance so that i could defend my actions in the future if the situation arises on a future evaluation , i would mention that i have paid close attention to the previous feedback , and was concerned enough to keep records at which point i would share with my manager the proof of my performance at work and request a further meeting with higher level management i would definitely volunteer for this opportunity i enjoy learning about other cultures i feel that my enthusiasm for the project would benefit me personally , as well as benefit the company i work for added benefits would be doing a job well , and advancing in the company
we will have to see who was the last to take a vacation whoever was last , will be the one that has to wait until the other gets back thats how it would be fair i would make sure that i get ahead of this project and finish it up i want to make sure that i get it done just in case something is thrown my way last minute i will be able to have more flexibility im going as it would be good for me its networking and its about meeting people i am going and will meet people to benefit me in the long run i would not be happy at all with this i would have to do something about it as this is going to cost me i am going to gather evidence to show that i am right in order to not be negatively affected by this i would find this very boring i dont feel that its exciting to have to tell someone about the country and its culture there is no fun in that for me at all
i would try to reschedule my vacation week if possible just to keep things good between us i would do whatever it takes to stay on good terms with my supervisor i consider myself a team player , so i would try to work something out and revise my plans i would try to get the project done as soon as possible , so i can get it out of the way especially since my boss tends to give me last minute projects the last thing i would want is to put the project off until the last minute and then have my boss give me a last minute task to do i would try to convince my colleague to go if he does not want to , i would attend the meeting because it is a big meeting not going to this meeting would be a big mistake for me i would politely try to explain to him why he is wrong if i ca n't , i have no choice , but to agree with him so i can stay on decent terms the last thing i want to do is to get fired and lose my job i would love to do this project i love learning about different cultures and to meet different kinds of people this would be a wonderful experience for me that i would enjoy greatly
i would talk to my colleague about their vacation the importance of their vacation plans if they have very important plans such as attending an important family event i would reschedule my vacation plans if i had very important plans , and i thought they did n't i would try to change their mind if i thought they were n't being reasonable i would talk to my supervisor and suggest that the person that should get the week off is the one that asked for the week off first i would try to do as much work as i could for the project due in two weeks i would try to work as if it was due in one week that way if my boss gives me a last minute task i could accomplish that without feeling too much pressure if my boss does n't give me a last minute task then i would have another week to work on my project in a relaxed way i would try to convince my colleague that it 's in their benefit to go to the networking meeting i would tell them that they could be the reason for future company success if they still did n't want to go i 'd go by myself i 'd introduce myself to people and try to build connections even if i do n't have my colleague as support putting myself out there would be better than skipping the meeting altogether i would feel very nervous and anxious about this situation i would talk to my manager and try to find out specifically why they gave that type of feedback i would try to look at the situation from their point of view even if i still do n't agree with their assessment after asking them about it i would tell my manager that i will work on my problems areas that they pointed out it 's important to leave them with a better impression i would find this experience enjoyable i think it 's interesting learning about new cultures and people i would also try to understand their business culture and how it operates and what positives and advantages it has i think that could help greatly in personal development for work and general development in encountering different situations
i would research my own travel plans and try and adjust accordingly so i can go another week without any hassle however , if my travel plans are time sensitive or critically important then i would discuss this with my coworkeri would get started on the work as soon as possible i would take a more organized approach to this as well where i either tackle all of the bigger or smaller tasks first i would also be prepared for any last minute tasks i might receivei would probably go along with this as it would lead to more personal opportunities if i am really close to my colleague , however , and he strongly suggests i do not go then i would consider skipping out on it i would put myself in the shoes of my manager and think about why they would think like this and what i could do to improve in their eyes due to the consequences essentially , i would eat crowi would find this experience enjoyable because i feel like it would promote personal growth on top of this i feel as though the company would trust me more and it would lead to more opportunities in the future
i would change my vacation plans it would n't really make a difference if i changed them this college is my friend ! i would get it done ahead of time if my boss gave me work that required more time it would n't matter i would already have it done i would go anyway i like meeting new people it would be a challenging experience i would talk to my boss about it i would ask for proof i would pray about it ! i would find it interesting i know nothing about norway it would be good to learn about norway and it 's culture
i would change my vacation plans most often , having this argument simply isnt worth the time and effort involved and would likely just stress me out i also do n't want to negatively impact my reputation with my colleague when i may have to work with them in the future i would work as much as i could on the project while i had free time i do n't want to get stuck with it later on and by completing it early , my boss may be pleased i would probably not go , even though i should it would be smart to go and network with the client , however i hate situations where i dont know anyone that would lead me to avoid that event i would approach my manager and ask to speak privately i would lay out my case and explain where i believe he is wrong if he continues there is a chance i would start looking ofr a new job i would enjoy it the act of learning is highly enjoyable to me and i want to add more of it to my life i dont know much about norway and id like to learn
i like to think that i lead a fluid and flexible life unless i have plane tickets or non cancellable reservations for a resort , i really do n't see a problem with changing my vacation to accommodate this could be multi faceted beneficially i would make the colleague happy by allowing him to take his already scheduled vacation i might also look more favorable to management since i was willing to change my plans , and possibly more opportunites would come my way \? since my workload is light at the moment , i would devote every minute i have while at work to the project i have two weeks , so i would get as much done as i can in the shortest amount of time i need to be ready for the boss to drop another nugget of work on my desk , so i need to make sure i have the time for both even if it means working through my breaks or lunch , i need to get this project out of the way i would be inclined to go these days , a good rapport with clients sometimes means more than the product service you offer by going , i can interact with the client and put forth a willingness to get to know them outside of our business relationship this may actually work out for the better in the long run , which could mean more or better opportunities for my company with the client i'm sure the event will be semi awkward at first , but there will be many people to talk to i would probably have a good time anyway , even though my colleague was n't there i'm obviously disappointed in this new situation i would probably give my manager a cooling off period , during which i would gather any information i had to support my case after a day or two or longer , i would ask to schedule a sit down meeting with my manager to discuss their decision i would try to explain my side , and present any evidence to try sway the decision i'm counting on that bonus , so i will do whatever it takes to at least try and win it back i would absolutely like to experience this i would enjoy it a great deal as i love to learn about new cultures i think first i would read the norway wikipedia page to familiarize myself with the basics then i might delve into a norway subreddit to see what the people are really like , and what they talk about etc i would spend an hour or two \( or more depending on how engrossed i get \) in learning the culture so i can better interact with the client
i would change my vacation dates , so long as it was n't too big of a hassle if i already had my hotel booked as well as flight and all that i would not change plans if it was earlier on and i could still get my deposit back in my plane ticket i would be willing to change vacation days i would get it out of the way as early as possible this would allow me to relax later on once it comes closer to the due date also i would not lose self esteem and feel like a procrastinator i would work on it in increments as well i would not go if my colleague did not go i do not show up well with people i do n't know also i am extremely quiet and introverted , so i would look like a loner there i would initially feel disappointed and like an idiot then later on i would say to myself what he thinks of me does n't matter , i know it 's not true in person near my boss i would apologize and try to avoid making those behaviors a habit around him or her i would find this enjoyable i am swedish and finnish myself so i would hopefully find out some more about my heritage if not at least the heritage of a nearby country
i would probably look into taking a different week for my vacation i would do this because my job is important to me i would not want to cause a big hassle my vacation plans could be changed easier then finding a new job i would do my best to continue working on the project every spare moment that i had i would do this because i do not like to wait until the last minute to finish my work that way if the boss does give me last minute tasks i would not be feeling stressed i would go without my colleague i feel that networking with one of my largest clients is necessary for my job i have no problem gping alone since i tend to be social and confident in my abilities i would feel a bit angry that this happened i would arrange to talk to my manager just in case something i did not understand was missed by me i would do this because i do not want to walk around with the anger i would want the situation resolved so it does not happen again i would find the experience enjoyable i like to learn about different countries and their cultures i think that it would make me a more productive employee
i would likely change my plans it would depend on my personal situation if it was too disruptive to make the change , i would talk to my co worker to see if a deal could be made i would start working on it immediately i tend to procrastinate , so i have to force myself to work on things proactively i would likely set a rough schedule to keep myself on track i would probably still go , but i would seriously consider not going i usually dread these types of events , but have a descent time when i actually go to them i would have a discussion with my manager about thier comments i would make sure that the facts are known and that the negative feedback wo n't be harmful to me if that does n't work i would involve my manager 's boss in the situation i would find this experience enjoyable i like to learn new things and learn about other cultures it seems like an interesting opportunity
i would discuss and ensure that his reason was valid as in he had something booked or arranged then if it was possible i would change my vacation time if not i would escalate it up to my manager i would schedule regular time each day , starting now , to complete the project early i would estimate from experience how long last minute tasks may take me and work that into the calculation at all costs i would make sure i had enough time to do the expected and the unexpected i would jump at the chance to go alone i have no trouble being comfortable with strangers and my colleague would be the one missing out by going i would be the one that would be remembered i would take a little time to get over my irritation and disappointment the when i was sure i would discuss with my manager , i would want to know whether this was just business or if there was a personal element to the feedback if i did not perform as expected then should he take some of the blame by not managing me sufficiently yes i would like to do that i already know a few things about norway and am interested in learning more i 've met many norwegians and generally have liked them i 've visited friends in sweden and finland and know a little about how things work in scandinavian culture
i would advice my colleague that he should try the best he can to change his vacation plans , as mine is already requested and is unlikely that he she would get it granted above mine that was already sent the company is unlikely to be unfair and move my week , in favor to your that was requested later i would handle it after all , that is probably what i am getting paid for but also i would question my boss about why i am getting the most time consuming and last task and not share it evenly with all the workers i would offer myself to go instead then , even if i do n't qualify for the meeting that is better than actually being absent from our team and i also get to help my colleague i would feel uncomfortable and upset , i would highly likely dispute with my superior the inaccuracy of the feedback and demand a review of it i would actually ask to volunteer myself ! i am always curious and willing to learn something new every now and then , and what not , is definitely a country that i would wish to visit be either for work or tourism purposes so no , that would n't be boring to me , quite opposite
i would still take my vacation it is not my fault that the other employee decided to take their vacation at the same time as me i am entitled to my vacation i would do it as soon as possible no matter how late my boss gives me a task , they would want it on the due date if not , i would be blamed i would still go , the networking event is meant to meet new people even without my colleague , i would introduce myself to others i would try to enjoy myself overall i would ask to have another meeting with my manager if i do not clarify mistakes they made it could lead to me being fired i would not like to be fired over a misunderstanding or disagreement i would find it enjoyable , learning about other cultures is something i would enjoy i would love to travel to norway and learn about them the culture of other countries is very interesting
i would talk to my colleague first to see if i could reason with them if that still did n't work , i would eventually take my vacation after them i would do this because i would n't want to cause any conflict and i want to show people at my job that i was the mature one i would handle the situation by staying at work late to make sure i get the project done if things got too hectic i would ask help from my colleagues the last resort i would tell my manager that i would need extra help i would still go even though my colleague is n't going i just think it would look bad if i did n't go my largest client will be there , this will be a great opportunity and i would n't want to miss it i would feel that the situation is really unfair and this really has me stressed about my job i would talk to who was the highest in charge and tell them what is going on i would want them to hear my side of the story and see what they think i should do i would find this experience very enjoyable i would find it enjoyable because i would learn something new i think this would be a great experience for me
i would ask the manager who has more seniority i would explain that , if i have the seniority , i should get the vacation time if i do n't then , i would change my dates that seems the fair thing to doi would make sure that i got the project done a s a p knowing that my boss gives me some extra work might interfere with my work on that project i would also ask the boss if he forsees any extra work at that time period i would go to the meeting it would not look good if no one showed up plus if i am the only one , i will get the credit it would not matter if i knew no one i would talk to my boss about the situation i would explain my side of the story see if i can change his mind if it did n't work , i would go over his head i would enjoy the experience i would ask to travel to find out as much as i could i would also see the travel as a mini vacation
i would concede to my colleague in the interest of team spirit and collegiality at work at the same time , i would also propose that we take a look at the following year 's calendar and make some tentative plans for the following year 's vacation schedules my hope would be that my teammate would take the hint and allow me first dibs on vacation dates for the year after this one if needed , i would make such a suggestion directly to my colleague first of all , i would set up a timeline for myself with completion dates over the next two weeks for various steps in the process i would think the project through , what needs to be done in what order , and how much lead time is needed for each step i would run the timeline by my boss or make her or him aware of how i plan to approach the project and use my time should my boss hand me last minute tasks that would significantly throw off my project completion timeline , i would be sure to tell him or her that the new task \( s \) would either delay my big project completion , or have themselves to be delayed until the big project is finished \( alternatively , i might ask for help such as a temp , volunteer , or other staff member to be lent to our team \) i would definitely go to the networking meeting first of all , it is one of our largest clients and that is very important second , i am not a shy person and have no hesitation in entering a room , group or meeting where i \( yet \) do n't know anyone i am certain that as the meeting goes on , i will get to know people and by the end i would know at least a few other people there by the way , the long day at work would have no impact this is a meeting after hours and outside the office , and might even be fun i would have to do some deep breathing and possibly ask for some time to think about the feedback , scheduling a follow up meeting for my response \( i do not love getting negative feedback unless the person is very skilled at doing it \) during the actual feedback , i would ask my manager for specific examples i would listen carefully and take notes i would ask my manager either then or at a follow up meeting if she or he would mind my posing a few questions that could shed more light on the situation \( or whatever gave rise to the negative feedback \) depending on how things went , i might also ask for the opportunity to write a response and have my response included in my personnel file we would also have arbitration of some sort , where a trained third party would listen to both sides of our issue i would find this experience extremely enjoyable and i would also , frankly , lobby for the opportunity to go to norway on the company 's dime ! i can see no downside at all to learning about another country and culture i would even do some of it on my own time , off the clock i would be watching norwegian films , reading norwegian literature , learning some basic norwegian language phrases such as greetings and question asking i would try to find a norwegian exchange partner with whom i could meet periodically to learn about each other 's cultures this would be a lot of fun
i would come to work i would not be pleased but i would understand next time i wished to go on vacation i would ensure that i requested the time off far in advance and get my supervisor to agree i would do everything possible to finish the project before the due date i would see this as an opportunity to get ahead of my workload when i finished i would hand it in and take on a new assignment there is no reason to procrastinate and to be honest it would make me look good i would go to the networking meeting i would not know anyone when i arrived but i would know people before i left this is a clear win for me as i would represent my area with the client and make some valuable contacts if i did not agree i would first talk to my supervisor and request clarification of the feedback i would want to know how and why the feedback was arrived at if i still did not agree , i would file and bounce an appeal upstairs and request a hearing at the same time , i would get the resume out and start work on it i would volunteer and break out the books anything you learn about the culture and client will be useful in the future even if you do not have a direct use for the knowledge later on it will broaden your horizons and make you a more well rounded person ,
i would lie to the employee i'm supposed to work it out with i 'd say that the vacation time is for the purpose of visiting some elderly family members who are ailing so that they would feel guilted into giving me the vacation time if that did n't work , i 'd insist to my manager that , based on either my seniority or \( if that was not relevant \) , my value and hard work for the organization , that i should get the week off i would not do anything related to it for the first week , and then rush to get it all done within the first and second day of the second week i would do this because , while i'm certain it would n't take me two weeks to complete it , i 'd be paranoid that if i waited until the very last minute , my boss would throw a bunch of other stuff at me i would definitely want to be done with the project at least three days in advance i would try to convince them to come along , because i want to go i usually do fairly well on my own in social settings , but it 's always nice to have someone to lean against i dislike having absolutely no one i know in a new place i would do some research into the issue and feedback , that way i could have a constructive conversation with my manager i 'd likely want to go ahead and have that conversation the same day that way no decisions are made based on our very first conversation i would find this experience immensely enjoyable even without the need to travel , i love to learn about other cultures and countries i think that it would enrich me , as a person
i would look and see if my vacation could be done right after my coworker if not , i would speak to my colleague and explain why i need to take the time off at that specific time if the employee still disagrees i will explain to my supervisor why i need the time off and leave the decision to them i would try to accomplish as much work as i can get done on the project and finish as fast as i can when i am finished , if i do not receive more tasks from my boss i will revise and add more detail to the project with my remaining free time if i need more time to complete the project i will tell my boss that i may be unable to do extra tasks until i am finished with my project i would kindly explain to my colleague that i do n't know anyone at the meeting and would greatly appreciated if he could do me a favor and come i would also explain to him how i would think going there will benefit them if they still wo n't go i would ask for advice on how to best handle the networking meeting i would feel a little depressed and anxious i would right down the areas i disagree with my manager and why i think i did better in those areas i would then speak to my manager and discuss where i think i did better and why i would find the experience somewhat enjoyable i find other cultures fascinating and interesting and enjoy learning new information , especially about history i would also inform the company i would be greatly interested in travelling to norway to help the client
i would let my other colleague stay with their original vacation plans i would n't want to cause any future friction between myself and my colleague so i would schedule my vacation for another time because i am a nice person and would n't want to deal with the drama work life is stressful enough and i do n't need to add any more stress than necessary i would immediately tackle this project and give myself a self imposed earlier deadline i would try to get it done as fast as possible and would work relentlessly over the next several days to complete the project i would do this so i could leave a cushion just in case my boss comes up with something else to do i would tell my colleague that they might think twice about not going to the networking meeting i would tell them to not think short term , but think long term how the networking might lead to something better and bigger some day i believe that a networking even is something that should n't be taken lighty as this is how a lot of people find new career paths by meeting someone new who can offer them a better job i would have to vent somewhere so i would call my wife and tell her what was going on if the negative feedback was n't true , i would have to immediately start putting in applications at other places of employment if someone has done their job correctly and in a timely manner , their raises and bonuses should not depend on the opinion of another person i would find this experience to be very enjoyable i would love to learn about norway and their cultures if i could travel there that would be a bonus if i could interact with the client in norway that would be really nice as well because it would provide me the chance to meet someone from that country that would be so exciting !
i believe the one who put in the request first should get the vacation if i was first i 'd explain that and tell them that if they want a week off , they need to say something before i had mine planned if they were first , i 'd change my week since my work load is light , i would work on the project until it is finished i would make sure that any free time is devoted to the project and make sure it is finished before the due date i would aim to get the project finished way before the due day my reaction changes greatly depending on my work i would go if my job was commission based as keeping my client happy and getting new clients would help boost my sales if my job was salary , i would decline i would be pretty mad if my feedback was n't helpful if the feedback disagrees with my personal thoughts , than i would speak with my manager to get a more constructive feedback to discuss it i would hope to agree more with their feedback after the discussion one of my favorite parts of any job is learning new things i would love the experience to learn stuff about a new country i would n't mind traveling
i would talk with my colleague and find out why they are unwilling or unable to change their plans if my plans are flexible , i would simply let them have the week and change my schedule if my plans were not flexible , i would talk with the colleague and supervisor together to see if we could work something out so both of us got at least part of the week we wanted off i would simply go ahead and complete the project while my workload was light there 's no reason to wait for the last minute and be overloaded with work the project is due in two weeks , but no one complains about getting something turned in early i would probably try to convince my colleague to go to the meeting with me if he could not be convinced , i would go on to the meeting without him large client or small client , they are all just people and should n't make me feel intimidated i would request a meeting with this manager and his superior i would try to find any coworkers who may have information or insight into the matter i would bring these coworkers and any witnesses with me to the meeting where i would plead my case to the manager as well as his superior in order to avoid consequences for something i did not do i would find the experience enjoyable i like to research and learn about places and cultures that i am not familiar with i do not , however , enjoy traveling ! since this would not be a requirement , i would like to volunteer !
i would , first off , explain the situation to my supervisor compromosing , in my honest opinion , would be the most reasonable option i would see if another co worker would take my place if that does n't work , i 'd probably cut my losses if the reason i was taking off was n't too important i would have to explain that to my supervisor most importantly , i would explain my dedication to the project i would just kindly ask him not to give me any additional tasks because i take pride in my work and i strive to do a phenomenal job i would still go to the networking meeting the reason being is because the whole purpose of networking is to connect with your clients potentially meeting or being referred to a new client could really make a statement towards my employer i would explain my point of view to my employer i feel like i should not submit to someone that is telling me i do something wrong when i , in fact , know i 've done something right often times in these situations , i 've found that just sitting down and speaking with the supervisor and explaining the situation works if he disagrees , generally , i go to my boss 's boss i would find this experience enjoyable the reason is that i particularly enjoy learning new cultures and traveling it is essential to branch your business out to new clients and niches
i would try to speak with my coworker and see if they 'd budge , or at least meet me halfway by perhaps delaying their vacation week by a few days if not , i 'd talk to my manager to see who asked for the vacation week off first if that all fails , i 'd probably just move my vacation to a different week , because by then i 'd imagine i 'd be sick of fighting over it , honestly i would be sure to wrap up the project as efficiently as i could it would leave me with more time to handle any surprise last minute tasks that my boss may throw at me i 'd also probably speak to my boss , as subtly as possible , trying to gauge whether or not they may have anything else they might spring on me , just to hedge by bets i would try to speak with my colleague to see if they 'd be willing to go anyway if convincing them fails , i would n't press the matter i might also see if another colleague of mine might want to go with them i may even see if i could invite a friend along as a guest , so as to feel more comfortable i would discuss it with my manager i might be able to find out the reason behind it and come to an understanding if that fails , i 'd just take one on the chin , because there 's not much you can do i would find it enjoyable i 'd be able to learn new things about a different culture , with the possibility of even traveling there it 'd be best to travel there and show the client how far you 'd go for them learning about their country and culture might open up possibilities for other potential clients from that country as well
i would ask them why they are not able to change their vacation plans then i would see if they would negotiate a better vacation plan to where we would n't take the vacations at the same also , i would tell my boss that he approved my vacation and he should honor it i would find the deadline for the project then , i would define all the specifics needed , like , resources and such , to complete the project next , i would see if any extensions of the project 's deadline could be extended i would still go if my co worker would not go i can still make connections without that person i would find someone to talk to it would be fun and i cannot make someone go i would ask for clarification on what they gave me negative feedback on then , i would ask for help in improving the problem if i am still not satisfied and cannot be helped i would like to continue to ask for advice from other people i think it would be a fun experience i would love to teach them as much as i could in addition , the co worker would learn and become more valuable
i would want to know what my colleague was going on vacation for , and consider it against what i was going on vacation for it would depend if i was able to rearrange my travel schedule , if i had already paid for it , and for what i was traveling for is my colleague just being rude and not wanting to be inconvenienced by having to reschedule their trip \? or , is it something important , like a funeral or a wedding \? i would prepare for this project as i would any other project just because i have two weeks to complete it , does not mean that i would wait until the last minute i would begin to working on it somewhat immediately , allowing for time to fix or change anything i might want to before the due date it would also allow me to have time for other tasks , should they arise i would go to the networking meeting regardless if my colleague went or not the whole point of networking meetings is to meet people you do n't know , so it would n't matter if i knew anyone or not if i do attend networking meetings with colleagues , we do n't tend to stick together once we get to the event anyways , so i would feel comfortable going alone i would ask for a formal meeting to discuss the negative feedback i just got back from my boss if i were positive it were n't true and were seriously worried about the consequences , i would research the problem myself and make sure i had enough information to present to my boss on how the feedback might not be 100 accurate i would also double check to see if there are any other higher supervisors that i might need to contact at a later date , should i need to do so i would find this experience enjoyable because i would be able to learn about a country that i might not be able to learn about in a normal scenario although travel is n't necessarily a need , it might be in the future , and i would like to be considered for that possibility should it arise i would also enjoy working with a foreign client and getting to know someone else 's culture outside of my own
i would try to change the week of my vacation if i couldn t i d insist they change theirs if not i ll put it off for a while i wouldn t want my workplace to struggle i would use my light workload to get some work done on the project i would not get behind so i could have free time if another assignment is given i would not chance not completing any work i would try to convince them to go if they went it would make us look stronger it s best to have as many ideas as possible so i d want them their for input i would feel i was unfairly evaluated i would work harder to remove all doubts i don t want to lose my bonus i would find it exciting i love to learn so i d be thrilled i d compile as much information as possible
i would explain to my co worker how important that it is to have my vacation that week i would also try to offer a favor to my co worker to persuade them to change their mind if my co worker still doesn't want to compromise i would suggest that it is randomly picked to avoid bias i would start on the project right away to avoid any last minute hassle any thing can happen at the last minute and i would not want it to interfere with the project i would try to persuade my colleague to attend with me and explain the benefits of attending attending the meeting can really help with the large client if my colleague decided not to go i will attend alone to represent the company even though i don't know anyone i would network as much as possible i would feel really discouraged about the situation , however i would speak with my manager to see what i could do to avoid consequences i would also let my manager know how important performing good is to my success with the company if my supervisor is still being negative i would speak with someone else who has authority i would find this experience enjoyable , because i love learning about new cultures whats good about this experience is that i can experience the culture without traveling this chance also may not happen again so i would have to take advantage while i could
unless i already had flights or hotel arrangements made , i would just change my vacation to a different week while i may not necessarily like it , if i did n't do it , there could likely be retaliation from this employee that could affect my job to me it 's not worth squabbling over unless i already have reservations made and paid for if that is the case the i would take the copies to my boss and show them and stand my ground i would get as much done on my project , if not all of it done , ahead of time if the boss has a history of giving things to me last minute , i do n't want to back myself into a corner of not being able to get it done , especially if my workload is light i would go if it 's one of our biggest client 's , it 's a good idea to go even if i do n't know anyone , it 's a networking meeting which means i would get to meet other people so it would be a benefit to myself and my company the first thing i would do is take a step back and regroup if i react to quickly , i may not say the right thing so i would probably wait a day or two and then go back to my boss to ask if we can discuss further and try to get to the bottom of where the information came from , etc i would find the experience interesting and beneficial the more i know , the greater benefit it will be to keeping the new client happy a happy client is easier to work with
i would then just allow my coworker to go ahead and take the vacation reason for that is since it is a vacation , not emergency , i am fine with delaying my vacation just so that everyone is happy on top of that the situation never mention rather if my traveling itinerary was already created or not base on the information i assume i have not made traveling arrangement and the like , so with that in mind i will not create any conflicts between me and the workplace further more , my coworker owe me one perhaps in the future when i need assistant , this can be use to barter i would no doubt use the best of my ability to perform what ever task my boss throw at me however , that is not to say i wo n't let my boss know if the task is way out of my ability to perform in a timely matter i will work on those projects , but if i need more time i will explain it to my boss that my hands or way too tied to complete the task that he throws at me last minute however , i will only do so unless if i ca n't accomplish the task this is so i can proof my work capability and that i can carry out stressful situations i would first explain the benefits to my coworker in attending the meeting if my coworker still decided not to attend , i will not force the issue i would then just attend the meeting myself since the only issue here is that i do n't know anyone in the meeting , which is fine for me after all this is a networking meeting , a meeting where you reach out to extend your network , which means you are suppose to be there to meet new people i would no doubt feel awful to be blamed for and penalized on something i feel unfair in situation like these , the only option i have is to ask my manager to have a private meeting with me in the meeting , i will propose my way of thinking with the situation i will bring forth any evidence and proof that might back up my claim on the situation i will use these information and explain it to my manager and hopefully he or she will come in line with me on my view perhaps , the situation might be reverse and i will receive my bonus and etc i would find the experience boring since the task is to ask me to learn about things or norway and its culture obviously without the ability to travel there , i will have to learn about the country base on books and other information i do n't find it will be enjoyable by learning a culture without the chance to experience it in person this will definitely hinder my ability to fully learn and experience the truth first hand in person , thus i find it 's rather bland and boring
i would probably rearrange my schedule and go at a different time i am usually flexible and unless it was an emergency situation it would be no big deal i do n't sweat the small stuff and save confrontation for when it is really important i would get started on it right away i would have it done in the event that something did come up at the last minute if not came up then i could just relax or focus on other things i would first try to persuade my colleague to go with me to the meeting if they still would n't go i would just go alone and try to make the best of it i would n't want to get into to trouble with one of my biggest clients i would ask for a meeting to clarify the situation i would calmly present my case and explain my side of things if i still felt i was being unjustly accused of something i think i would try to take it to higher management and also start looking for a new job i would find this project very enjoyable i think it would be a great opportunity to learn something new if i did get to travel to norway it would just be a bonus , and if not i may decide to go on my own anyway
i would change my plans but would ask for something in return for putting my plans on hold i would ask the other employee if he she would cover for me at some date if i needed her to i would finish the project right away that way if my boss gave me additional work i would be able to get it done i would not go alone without someone with me i would be too uncomfortable to do any good anyway i would probably try and talk my co worker into going even if only for a short time if i felt the feedback was wrong i would ask for a meeting to discuss it with my manager if that did not get any positive results i would then appeal to human resources to try and fix the situation i would enjoy learning about another country and their culture it would be enjoyable in that way it would also possibly open up new opportunities
i would try to change my time if it was not something absolutely non refundable such as a plane ticket if it was something i could not move around , it would seem that the coworker with more seniority should receive the time off i would suggest the supervisor take into account seniority as well as how long the request had been in i would try to get as much done as possible earlier than the deadline that way , if i got more work later , i would n't be struggling if i did n't get more work , i 'd have time to review and finalize i would not go because i am very introverted i would go only if my supervisor expected it or if there were very important clients there i would ask for a meeting with the supervisor to discuss the situation further i 'd ask for examples in which i 'd engaged in the poor behavior i 'd provide my side of the story i would find it enjoyable and exciting i like talking with people from other countries i think i could be warm and helpful
i would try to change my plans i prefer to maintain positive working relationships with my colleagues , so i would try to be accommodating if traveling for a family reunion , wedding or other event that could n't be changed , i would let my colleague know to see if , based on the additional information , they could change if they still could n't , i would ask my boss if she would be o k for both of us being out , for a day or two and if approved , i would just take a shorter vacation i would finish the project in advance if possible if it would not be possible because i was waiting for information , or data to accrue , i would finish as much as i could in advance and then estimate the time on task to completion then when the boss can in with a last minute project , i could say , i know you wanted the weinus report by date but it will take me hours to complete that what is your priority for me now \? turning the weinus report in on time or completing this new project \? this is what i would imagine myself saying , but oftentimes i have just sucked it up and worked unpaid overtime to get both jobs done i would try to persuade my collegue to go to just make a quick entrance and exit if he or she could n't be persuaded , i would go , quickly make the rounds and go i would go because decline invitations can sometimes leave a lasting negative impression and i would n't want to do that with a large client i would feel awful about this situation i have been in reality throughout my career , in this situation a number of times what i would do is try not to take things too personally , sit down and calmly discuss with my boss i would ask for examples , data , statistics , feedback from other clients and colleagues then i would ask my boss what i could do to maintain my good rating and annual bonus i would very much working with a client from norway i would n't mind traveling there either i love to learn languages and culture i think it would be really interesting to find out what the unique needs and interests are of the norweigan people and how we could best be of service to them
i would change my vacation time to accomodate my coworker i would do this because it does n't matter when i take vacation as long as i still get to take vacation i would want to show my employer that i am flexible and a team player and it would reflect well on me i would immediately begin the project if i give 100 effort but start working immediately i can complete the project ahead of schedule and still have time for random popup tasks that my boss will give me this not only shows that i can do tasks on time but that i can prioritize , and also handle anything thrown at me i would explain to my coworker that unless he she goes i wo n't be able to adequately represent our workplace i would implore him her to come to the networking meeting to present a good face for our company i know they are tired but it 's business i would ask to sit down with my manager and have a meeting i would go over everything that he she negatively critiqued and present my point of view i would own up to the mistakes that were mine but make sure my manager knows that i am serious about my work and want to work on myself and work efforts i would find this experience enjoyable ! i love learning about new cultures and countries i would find it intriguing not only for my personal information but also so that i can relate to the clients in the future when the need arises , whether i have to go there or not
if i had plans that could be changed , i would change them and take vacation during a different week if my plans could not be changed , i would inform my supervisor of that i would not discuss it with the co worker , as the outcome is not his decision i would get started on the project right away and try to turn it in early anything could happen in two weeks there could be a new project , i could get sick , etc i would n't stay late to get it done , but i would be efficient in getting it done in a timely manner so i would n't be stressed if something came up at a later date i would not really want to go , but i would go i would promise myself that i would stay for an hour if it went well , and i was getting good work done and enjoying myself , i 'd stay longer if not , i 'd duck out after the hour was up and i 'd greeted the client i would ask my manager how they would like for me to do things in the future i would then stick to his instructions to the letter , and be diligent about documenting my work i would not be happy about the situation , but i would realize that i need to cover myself i would thing it would be interesting i do n't much like to travel , but i like learning new things and meeting new people i would be happy to be involved on the project for a change of pace
i would likely change my vacation plans to a different week , probably the week after i feel like it 's not worth fighting over and i would enjoy my vacation the same regardless of what week it 's on i think it must be important for them to have the vacation on that week and i do n't want to make things hard on them i would divide up my time carefully in the two weeks to make sure i could successfully complete the project i 'd get all my other work out of the way first and then diligently work on the project each day i 'd set aside enough time each day to work on the project so that i can dedicate enough time and attention to it i would probably decide not to go because it would be much too nerve wracking to try and go alone i would wait till the next meeting so that i could feel more comfortable i think if i decided to go to the networking meeting , i would end up being too nervous to make a good impression , and it would n't be worth it at all i would feel really bad and disappointed in myself i would ask to speak to the manager and try to understand why they gave me negative feedback then , i would explain why their evaluation is unjustified , in the hopes that they change their mind i would find it enjoyable because i 'd get to find out more about norway as a person who loves learning about new cultures , it would be very rewarding for me it 's not necessary to travel , but i would want to just so i could learn as much as possible
i would explain to my colleague that i also have vacation plans that ca n't be moved i would explain that i have a unique family situation that requires me to take that week off , and it would be a significant hardship to move my plans in fact , it could not be done at all i would also reason with my colleague that i have n't taken vacation in a longer time than him , and thus should have my vacation plans stand i would take a pretty hard stance on this because i should n't be the one to budge if my colleague has similar or worse reasons for not budging i would let my boss know about my project and the deadline i would ask that my boss give me the ability to dedicate all of my time to this project , and ask that other last minute tasks be delegated to my colleagues i would also give my colleagues a heads up that i might need more of their help covering for these kinds of last minute requests , given the nature of my big project i would do these things to free up my time and give myself more breathing room i would convince my colleague to go i would tell my colleague it 's a great opportunity with free food and drinks i would try to hype the event up to show my colleague why it 'd be worthwhile for him to accompany me to the meeting i would do this because i would feel an obligation to attend the meeting myself i would feel awful about the situation and it 'd really weigh on me i would ask to speak with my boss again separately i would explain my reasoning for why that feedback is n't true , and would give him space to consider my logic i would ask him to reconsider the consequences and give me a second chance , pointing to my otherwise positive track record at work i would find this experience enjoyable , because it would be fun to work on an international project it 's something different from what i 'd usually do at work and would be a nice change of pace i would also be able to show off my willingness to be proactive at work
i would consider whether they had worker there longer than me , if i had been there longer than them i would not back down but tell he boss that it has to done by te tie of hiring if the other had been ther elonger than me i would change my plans for the vacation so there would be not hard feelings about iti would stay focused on the task i am doing right now that way if the boss hands me something that could take some time to do for the same project i would be able to handle it and not have to worry about not making the dead line in case something took longer i would keep on the track and i would be ready if something happenedi would go and tell the colleague that one of us need to be there to learn new things and to make are selves look good it would exciting and something different , i would still try and get my colleague to g and explain to them that they need this it would great for them and maybe lead to something new i would question the manager about this and ask if they felt it was true about me , or to prove it is true about me that i do not want to lose my bonus over something that was mistaken or was not true i would stand up for my selfi think it would very interesting to learn something new i feel that the work would be really interesting and could help me in the future on other projects , that would make me look like a very good employee it would be interesting learning about a different culture than mine to see how they do things
i would most likely be more than willing to change my week i would n't have finalized my plans anyway , before i got the approval from my boss i would try to be nice and accommodating for both my boss and coworker and i would just take a different week i would get started on this project as soon as possible and pace myself over the next two weeks i would try to get it done early if possible i would want this project done early so that i'm ready if my boss gives me last minute tasks i would try to think for myself independently of what my coworker wants to do for me it would depend on whether it 's a big deal to skip things like this at my work if it 's not a problem to not go , then i definitely wo n't go i do n't like these types of get togethers i would feel really upset and disappointed to be in a situation like this i would approach my manager with my concerns and hopefully they would see things my way if not , i would try to correct the negative things that were told to me and do better next time i would really enjoy an experience like this i love learning about different countries and cultures i think this would be quite interesting it would be amazing to get to travel to norway as well
i would take a look at my own schedule to see if it was more mobile as it is likely that is is , i would change my schedule if i could not change it , i would try to work out a compromise if that failed , i would ask my supervisor who requested first i would work on this project as soon as possible i like to be done with projects ahead of time i would be less stressed to know i could get all the work done i would probably ask them to come with me i am not great at networking on my own if they did not go i probably would not either i would bring the situation up with a higher up i do n't think that the review is a fair assessment i would fight to have the feedback looked at by someone else i would find this experience enjoyable i like to learn about new cultures i know nearly nothing about norway and would find it interesting
i would reconsider my plans for vacation if i have no commitments out of work \( e g the vacation is needed to spend time with family \) , then i would change my plans i would normally finish the project and make sure the work meets the definition of done as soon as possible if i end up with other tasks to complete and they are not done in time , that 's too bad if the other tasks are more critical , however , then i would abandon the project to focus on them first if the project is n't done by the deadline , then that 's too bad i would avoid going to the event , if possible i am personally uncomfortable in social gatherings if i do n't anyone there , then things will be even more awkward i would probably first try to find out the cause of the negative feedback even if the feedback is n't true , there should still be a reason why it exists depending on the nature and severity of the root cause , i may work with the manager \( or other parties \) in resolving those issues i would probably find this enjoyable , merely because i do n't have to travel and if i do n't have to travel , i probably do n't need to meet the client in person either learning and experiencing new things and new culture , without having to set foot in another country , sounds fun
i would determine who put the request in first if my colleague did then i would change my plans however if it was me then i would go to hr if my workload is light , then i 'll do the project early it only makes sense given that my boss might give work unexpected plus after i do it , i wo n't have to worry about it i would go even if i do n't know anyone it 'll benefit my career if i went i can make new clients there and thus earn more money i would try to reason and explain myself then maybe ask for a redo of the project how my boss would like it then if that 's not the option i would go to hr or whoever ranks above my manager i would find this enjoyable as i enjoy learning about different cultures i would also love to travel there , if my company is paying for my travel also hopefully this would include a pay raise
i would approach my colleague first and try to figure out who put in the request first second i would see if they are vacationing with family or not if not then i would n't back down worst comes to worst i 'd ask my supervisor to be the tie breaker i would handle this project just like i would handle my projects in college i would get started on the project and do as much as i can for as long as i want knowing that i have some time to go would allow me to take mental breaks whenever i feel necessary instead of having to cram , especially if i might get extra work soon i would have a conversation with my colleague if he falls one way or another i 'd follow if they could n't decide then i would just decide not to go i would confront my boss about this if i do n't agree with the feedback then its up to me to plead my case i would try to see my boss' point of view and give them mine after that we would try to figure out a middle ground i would definitely volunteer to join this project i love learning about new cultures and i do n't think i really know anything about norway and on top of that i could possibly travel so yeah i would be in
i would see if i could reschedule my vacation plans i would also ask my coworker if their plans were able to be rescheduled i would request off a different week if completely necessary to help the business out i would be determined to finish this project i would start by prioritizing all of the tasks i 've been given to make sure i'm hitting my deadlines i would work overtime and off the clock if it was necessary i would go to the meeting if my colleague went i would most likely not go to the meeting if they did n't go , mainly because i would feel alone i would most likely go home and go to sleep if that were the case i would ask the reasoning for the negative feedback i would also ask what i could do to improve on those things i would be upset and would be determined to work hard to make those negatives into a positive i would definitely be interested and would enjoy this task i would love to travel to norway to learn about the country and culture and report back i would be willing to move there full time if necessary
i would talk with my supervisor i 'd ask him who put in for vacation time first then suggest that whoever did , should get it i would begin working on it between other projects it is better to plan for the unexpected than be caught off guard then piece it together i would talk to my colleague and see why she did n't want to go depending upon her reaction , i would either try to convince her to go or understand then i 'd still go to the meeting i would sit down with my manager and ask exactly why he gave me the feedback i would ask him to give me specific examples if he could n't and really was wrong in doing that , i 'd go above him or to hr i would find this enjoyable ! it 's a nice break from the mundane learning about other cultures and having a chance to use that knowledge is amazing
i would ask them if they had planned a vacation to go somewhere i would ask them to discuss who is going on a non refundable vacation if they are going on a trip somewhere besides a stay cation i would be willing to choose a another week i would try to get it done as fast as i could i would do this because of the last minute task that my boss might throw in with my project and regular workload i would try to leave the project open to new ideas as they come from my boss i would ask them to reconsider their decision if they decided they would not go i would go anyway because it could further my career i would be able to meet people their and have a good time regardless if i did n't know anyone i would be very mas at my manager and demand a explanation if the manager could not provide me with a legitimate reason for giving me negative feedback i would go to a higher superior i really do n't want to get my manager in trouble but if they are not telling the truth they should be punished i would find the experience enjoyable i would get to learn about another culture and gain more knowledge to further my career i really would jump on this project to get a leg up in the company
i would not book a vacation without making sure i could get the days off first i would change my vacation dates i would then find the best deal for another date , especially if my co worker already booked their vacation or i would find out who had the day reserved first i would start the project early and create a timeline for it then you can plan to be done early i would build in extra time at the end that way i can be prepared for unexpected things i would make my friend go i would ask them to go and bother them until they decided to go i would offer to carpool alternatively , if they really don t want to go , i would just stay home i would feel upset i would ask for a time to review this with the manager and come prepared with infomation to show they are wrong then if this does not work i could talk to another boss i would find this boring it would be boring to learn about the culture but not be able to travel there the best way to learn the culture would be to travel i would want to find a way to travel there
i would say my vacation plans were not able to be changed and stick to taking my vacation i do n't feel like i should have to give up my plans if i already planned on taking it off i might try and find someone to cover my work while i was absent i would try and give my full attention to getting the project done as early as possible i would work hard and do a good job on it but if i finished early it would allow me time if my boss gave me extra projects that way i would be able to do a good job on all the projects involved i think i would go to the networking meeting it would be awkward but i would just have to try my best to meet new people i think it would be a valuable business move and i would be missing out if i did n't go i feel hurt and let down i think i would talk to my manager and see if i can explain why i do n't agree with the feedback if need be i would bring higher management into the situation i think if the issue would effect something as big as my annual bonus i would do whatever i needed to to ensure it did n't happen i would find it enjoyable i would really love if there would be some traveling involved , but i love learning about new places i think it would be great to step out of the boundaries of a normal project and experience new things
first , i would try and schedule a meeting with my boss and coworker to discuss the situation further i want to understand why he can only do his vacation at that time after talking , and if he is not able , i would probably ask for my time directly before of after his this way we both can have our vacation and coverage at work i am willing to be flexible in this situation i would do as much as i can to finish the project early knowing how my boss is , i will be prepared to take on anything else , need be since i have the time , it is better to be prepared than not to be this way i avoid any stress or last minute rushes i would first try and talk my coworker into going if this was not successful , i would be courageous and go by myself i think that the relationship with this client is to important to not go i would just try and charm anyone there i would try and approach my boss to discuss the situation maybe there is something we can resolve to amend it if not , i have to accept responsibility for my actions and try to do better in the future this would motivate me to be more thurough in the future i would definitely love this opportunity i love learning about new cultures and experiences i also think this would be impressive on my resume for future projects i would gladly accept the challenge
i would change my vacation plans if it did n't inconvenience me if it inconvenienced me i would ask our supervisor to decide who gets the desired vacation time if still not satisfactory i would consider offering money to the colleague if i was really serious otherwise if i got my way , i would let the colleague get their way the next time i would try to get the project mostly done before the two week deadline so i 'd have time available to deal with last minute tasks i 'd also ask the boss to give me a heads up about any last minute projects they might know about if they can predict i would also consider asking the boss to spread out the last minute tasks or try to decline some of the last minute tasks or delegate them i would probably go anyway someone should go and let the colleagues know what happens otherwise , try to persuade the colleague to go also , as it is a networking meeting it would behoove me to make some new friends at the meeting i would feel that the manager does n't really know my work i would ask for a meeting with the manager to try to change the evaluation i would also ask around and see if anyone has been saying negative things behind my back i would ask what specific incidents occasioned the negative feedback so i could register an appeal i would find the experience enjoyable because i am interested in new cultures i would probably try to learn a little norwegian and study some history and watch some programs about norway if it were a long running project i might even book a trip to norway as a vacation
i would first speak with my husband and try to figure out if there 's any way we can change our vacation plans if not , i would request a meeting with both my colleague and our supervisor to try to talk this all out i would make sure that if i end up being the one to switch plans , i would get first choice of vacation time the next time around i would tackle the project right away and try to finish it as quickly as possible that way , if last minute tasks from my boss pop up , they would n't derail me too much i do n't work as well under a time crunch , anyway i would try very hard to convince my colleague to go to the meeting with me , even if just for a little while i would remind him her of the benefits of going to the meeting keeping up a good report with our large client , meeting new potential clients , etc plus , it would make our boss happy ! if he or she still refuses to go , i 'd go by myself and just stay for a short time i would feel anxious and upset about this situation i 'd immediately request a meeting with my boss to discuss the negative feedback i 'd ask for the reasoning behind the feedback , and then calmly explain why i do n't believe it 's true before the meeting , i 'd gather work examples and evidence to back up my position i would find this experience enjoyable because i always like learning about new places and cultures it would keep things fresh and interesting at work and allow me to network with new people however , i would secretly hope that i 'd somehow be able to travel to norway to meet the client !
i would speak with my colleague in an attempt to understand why he is unwilling or unable to change his vacation plans if my vacation plans were flexible then i would change my plans and let my colleague take his vacation other wise , i would try to persuade him to change his plans and offer something in return \( e g , cover a shift i know he does n't want to work \) if i was unsuccessful in getting him to change his vacation plans then i would talk to my supervisor and insist that as a supervisor he intervene and decide who gets to take vacation that week i would express my concern with my boss i would let him know that i am confident in my ability to take on this project but i want to clarify expectations and ensure that there will not be any last minute tasks that can potentially jeopardize the deadline i would go to the networking meeting even though i wo n't know anybody , it is a good opportunity to meet new people and possible generate new business leads i would explain why i do n't agree with the feedback and offer examples or alternative information to demonstrate how the feedback is inaccurate and provide a more robust and balanced view of my performance obviously , i would not feel good about getting negative feedback , but i would try to embrace it with an open mind and attempt to understand why my boss has that perception i would find the experience enjoyable i think it is interesting to learn about other countries and cultures it helps to make one a more well rounded individual and can be helpful if there is ever an opportunity to visit norway or interact \( even by email or phone \) with people from that country
since my colleague is not willing to change their plans , then i will be the bigger person and change mines instead it would n't make a big difference to me because what i have planned can wait i do n't mind doing things like this and plus it makes me look good as a person i would handle this project the best way i can being i'm the type to get things done in a timely manner , i would do my absolute best to get it done as possible i would just set everything and break it down by different times and wont spend so much on a task well to put it like this , if my colleague does n't go then i wont go if my colleague go then i 'll go it 's just simple as that there 's no sense in me going and i wo n't know anyone there that would be just a waste a time so no i would n't go at all being that i do n't agree with this feedback , i would possibly say something about it but i will say it in a calm way i would n't get out of line about it unless i was provoked to do it but i 'll keep it simple and classy i would feel very uneasy about it since it 's clearly something odd about the situation i would fine it enjoyable because not only i would be learning new things , but i 'll be learning new things about the country and culture i would find that very exciting as well and i can learn all types of different things about the country and culture just learning about it is enough for me to find it enjoyable and interesting
i would not have a problem with rescheduling my vacation i would assume my colleague had big plans for his vacation vacation for me would no doubt involve simply not being at work no particular plans i would make the project a priority if i have the project completed way before the deadline , it would n't matter if my boss gave me last minute tasks the last minute tasks could easily be handled if i do n't have to work around the original project i would go it would be an opportunity to meet new people and make contacts for business this could be of help with this client as they would see me as dedicated to my job and their interests i would question the negative feedback directly with my manager if he still insists the negative feedback is accurate , i would accept that it is correct and try and do better this is a situation where i would do what 's necessary to avoid negative consequences i would find this experience boring i have no interest in other countries and cultures i would not be the right person for this project
i would talk to my colleague about his vacation plans i would see if its possible we could trade vacation days for a time he wants and a time i want if he is unwilling to trade , i will try and find a time that i need as soon possible , so it does n't get taken first i would handle this project with good planning i would setup my calendar to block out time for the project and l would make sure the project is done , and make sure there is time for other odd items given i would go to the networking meeting i would make sure i was there because it could pay out huge dividends because is with one of my largest clients regardless if my colleague is there or not , i would definitely make it a priority to be there i would talk to my manger about the negative feedback i would discuss what made them think that to see if i could prove my point that its untrue if they are unwilling to back off from their feedback , i would resolve to just get better next year and try to act on that feedback i would definitely enjoy learning about another country , culture and language i think it would provide an opportunity to learn a unique skill , talent and knowledge about something and someplace that not many here in the united states know about this would be an enjoyable experience for me
i would try to negotiate i would ask if they have anything in particular planned and if i do and they do n't maybe we could rearrange it it seems the most straightforward first step i would make it known that this project is my main concern and that other things will have to wait until it 's finished or the project may suffer i would suggest other team members that can do the job adequately i would make sure i had my priorities straight i would go anyway this is part of my job and i have to make sure it gets done i have to take one for the team i feel really anxious about it i would see if there is anyone else above him who might feel differently , maybe talk to colleagues and see if they agree i would want to know if it 's something i am doing i would love it i really enjoy learning about other cultures i think norway is a very interesting country
i would change my vacation plans and let my colleague take his her vacation on the week that i had planned my vacation it does n't make sense to cause workplace tensions over leisure activities if i were to try and fight with my colleague over who gets to take vacation , it would only complicate our relationship and make things worse in the long run i feel that by conceding , i not only avoid unnecessary tension , i improve my standing with my supervisor if any conflicts arise in the future , i will be able to point to this particular incident to show that i had already made a concession and that other people will need to reciprocate to maintain fairness in the workplace i would work on the project as soon as possible and aim to complete it ahead of schedule this allows me to double check the work in the event that no further tasks are assigned it also ensures that i have ample time to complete additional tasks if my boss decides to give me something else during the two week period in which i have to complete the project i prefer to avoid procrastinating whenever possible for fear of having too much on my plate with little time to accomplish everything assigned to me i would attend the meeting regardless of what my colleague decides to do although i may not know anyone at the meeting , the entire purpose of the event is to make myself known to other people this increases my visibility in the organization and with the organization 's clientele not only will i be able to ingratiate myself with our clients , i will be opening doors for opportunities in the future in some ways , it is better if my colleague does not attend because it prevents me from spending too much time with people i already know and instead forces me to be gregarious and meet with new and unfamiliar faces instead i would ask my supervisor additional questions regarding my performance i might consider arguing my perspective and trying to explain why i think the feedback might be unwarranted i think the best course of action would be to simply grin and bear it , then spend time thinking over what was discussed in our conversation nobody is perfect , and this negative feedback could be a lesson on being a more humble and conscientious worker i would undoubtedly be frustrated by the negative feedback at first , but after i 've had time to process my emotions , i would likely try to take the feedback into consideration and work on making the necessary changes in order to avoid negative consequences at work i would find the experience to be enjoyable i have always liked learning about different cultures even if i am unable to immerse myself in it by traveling or visiting different countries i feel that volunteering for the project will help to expand my horizons and improve my image with my supervisor the project will also likely be a welcome change to my daily activities because it involves doing things differently and this helps to make the work more engaging
i would talk to my colleague and see if there was a compromise we could come to then , if they still would not change anything i would end up trying to reschedule my own vacation i would want to be the bigger person and seem versatile to my boss by changing my vacation i would start to work on the project a little each day so that in the case i was given another task i would not feel overwhelmed i would plan out the parts of the project that i would work on each night and make deadlines for myself i would give the project extra time and thought so that way i make it professional and put my best effort into it i would still go to the meeting even if i stayed for a short amount of time i think that it would look good for me to be present at a meeting with a large client and i could meet new people and make new connections i would stay and introduce myself and hopefully staying would benefit my career in the future i would try to speak to my manager and voice why i felt that their feedback was wrong i do n't want to lose my bonus and i feel that standing up for what i believe is the right thing to do i would try to show the manager my point of view and write down the list of reasons why i felt that i did the opposite of what they said in their feedback i would find this experience enjoyable because i would want to learn about norway and its culture i would n't have to travel anywhere and could enhance my education and knowledge of other places i like to learn about other places in the comfort of my own home because it is informative and i do n't feel the stress of having to travel
i would try and find a way to reschedule my vacation if possible if that were not possible i would try and find a way for us both to be able to take vacation at the same time or work ahead so i would be able to take vacation i would ask my boss to outline everything they expected of me so that i knew i could plan ahead i would also be sure to check in every so often making sure there was nothing i was missing finally as it got closer to the deadline i would try and plan extra time to work on unexpected tasks i would also plan on finishing early so i had extra time to work i would try and convince them that they should go if that did not work i would see if any other individuals at my office would be able to go and are free that night if none of that works out i may try going by myself i would intentionally try and make friends at the networking meeting so i did n't feel alone i would attempt to verify the negative feedback and ask for examples this could easily be disguised as asking for ways to improve myself i would also try and pursue this up the chain of command if i am unable to deal with the manager and take care of the issue i would find the experience intriguing but i would be unlikely to take it i personally tend to enjoy sticking around home and all of the people in my life i also have a lot of commitments around my city and would hate to have to go back on some of those i would therefore not want to take the experience as i feel i would be losing more than i was gaining
i would be willing to change my vacation request i would , however , require that i be given the opportunity to select whatever week i wanted outside of this week i would also hope that my manager note my flexibility in this issue i am a worrier given that i would work as hard and fast as possible to get the project done before the 2 weeks is up if i turn it in early it would show my boss how diligent and efficient i am i would go to the meeting it wo n't be easy not knowing anyone there but i feel it would be worth trying to meet others there it 's not the type of thing i like doing but i think it would be worth a try i would ask my manager what this feedback is based on i would politely ask for the facts and the source of the facts since the feedback has consequences my manager should not have a problem giving me this information if he she does then i would have to consider going above him to get help i would find this very enjoyable i would n't be crazy about traveling to norway but have no problem learning about other cultures i think it would be fun and help make my job more interesting ,
i run into this all the time it would depend on what my plans were did i have airline tickets that could not be changed who made the request first if i made it first and had firm plans i would not change mine to accommodate them if i was just going to be around home than i would have no problem taking a different week as long as the same consideration was made for me in the future i always finish a project as soon as possible for exactly the reason in this scenario the old saying of never put off until tomorrow what you can do today should always hold true at work personally i would not go i never go to after work functions because that is my time even though i am a salaried employee unless i am traveling for work i should add in that case i would be there because it does not take away from my family everyone has a different perception and the first thing i would do is ask how they view what i did and then if i did do as they say then i need to learn from it if i see it differently than i let them know what my thoughts or intentions were at the time i also change on the outside what ever is perceived as negative \( maybe i do n't change my thoughts \) i think i would find it enjoyable for a couple of reasons i like to learn new things and i like being on projects there is a sense of accomplishment once implemented
i would look to see how important the week i needed off was then i would change if it was n't important if it was important , then i would make a case to my colleague and my boss to explain why i would complete the project as early as possible given the likelihood that i will be given last minute tasks , i would ensure i had plenty of time to do them i would make sure everything would run as smoothly as possible i would try to convince my colleague to come it would be important to meet with one of my largest client i would still consider going if my colleague does n't go since the client is important i would tell my boss how i felt i would explain to my boss why the feedback is n't true i would be kind and sincere about it i would find this experience enjoyable it would be interesting to learn new things i would welcome the opportunity even if i did n't get to travel
i would compromise in this situation and give up my week of vacation but only if i had not yet made reservations or paid nonrefundable deposits i would graciously conceded my vacation to make my coworker happy however , i would also make it clear that i will be taking my vacation at a later time and that i would get precedence over my coworker to take time off at that time i would start working on this project right away while i have the time and energy to do so i would get as much done as i could now in anticipation of future projects from my boss that could take up all my time allotted to the project i would also work extra hours at home in the evenings if i needed the extra time to complete everything by the deadline i would lean towards going to the meeting as it seems to be a good opportunity to network with our clients it seems prudent to go and meet important people and to show my face at an event like this i may not stay long and i may see who else i know is going , but i would choose to at least drop by for a short amount of time i would discuss this with my boss and ask for further explanation of this negative feedback i would politely express my disagreement with the feedback i would then ask how i can remedy the situation so that the adverse consequence can be minimized i would find this experience enjoyable because it brings the opportunity to learn new things about a different country and culture , which seems to be outside the norm for work i also find this type of information interesting the fact that travel is not necessary is also a plus as my current family life is not conducive to lots of work travel i would be very interested to learn how the culture and the people in norway are the same or differ from our culture here in america
it all depends on if i have something planned for the vacation if i do , i will try to talk with the other colleague and see if we could compromise a solution if i ended up not able to take the vacation , i definitely will put in my time in advance next time and make sure i get approval before planning anything next time i would do the project right away i prefer to get things done asap if i have time just stated in the question , my boss could give me some extra work load unexpected so why not take care of stuff while i have time that way i'm prepare for the unexpected i possibly will go for the networking meeting it 's work related anyway i think if i missed out on these meeting i may not be in the loop besides you never know what you miss out if you do n't attend you may ended up gain a lot by attending i would feel really offended i will talk with my manager first and see if that could get resolved if it does n't get resolve and i still believe i'm right then i will find out what 's the grievance procedures in the company if the company grievance procedures ca n't get it resolve it will be time to call the labor department and see if they will get involve i would love to have that experience i always love to learn something new i'm kind of an adventurous person i have lived in 2 different continents besides the us so that tells you a lot
i would let them have the vacation if and only if my plans could be delayed otherwise , i would hopefully have gained enough favor with my supervisor to convince him her to give me the vacation i would also start looking for another job if this became a big issue i would try to get as much completed as quick as possible if i get it done quickly then i can either slow down to a crawl and go over my work or be better prepared for any surprise tasks i could also used the time saved focus on myself i would try to attend regardless networking is extremely important part of business and could help my career also , me showing up will make me look better i would attempt to respectfully disagree with the manager hopefully , i would have proof to show him her that the feedback is wrong if it does not go well , i would consider looking for a new job i would find it boring if no travel was involved while learning about other cultures can be interesting , it gets much better when actually going to said place if travel was involved , i would find it very enjoyable
i would say it is ok for this time but i will take the next vacation i do n't want to create a tension between us but i will make sure everything will be fair i hope s he will know that i try to understand his her position but it has to be mutual i would try to finish the project and any tasks from my boss maybe i will take some home , if possible if i am overwhelmed with the situation , i will tell my boss and ask for someone to help me maybe a coworker to help with the last minute task i would not go either because i do n't want to feel awkward and out of place i think we should go as a team because we are a team after all , we had a long day and i just want to go home and rest too i would just give in and try to do better the next time maybe my boss has a reason to give me a negative feedback i will prove to him that i can do better maybe i would ask my coworkers about the feedback as well and if they think i did something wrong i would love to be involved in the project i would find it to be enjoyable and a new experience for me especially if i can go to norway i love to see other countries and explore their culture i think i will gain a lot of experiences and network from this project
i would also tell the boss that i'm not changing my plans and ask him what he wants us to do i know if i have plans i 've already purchases plane tickets and booked hotel rooms i would work on the project during every free moment i had i would like to do that in case my boss does throw extra work my way i have to be prepared for any scenario that may occur i would talk to my colleague and find out the reason why they do n't want to go if it is a reason that i could help them with , i would otherwise i would probably stay home too i do n't feel there would be a lot that i could do about this situation my boss has a right to his opinion i am not fond of traveling for work , so this would not be ideal for me i think if i did it would be nice to see how the company operates in another country
i would talk to my supervisor about the situation i would ask to see if there was some sort of solution if i was the first to request vacation i would not back down and let them have it if it came to it , i would see if we could do a draw to solve it i would would work to finish the project early if my boss gave me last minute work , i would then have time to do it if not it would give me time to ask for another project and show initiative i would go to the meeting either way even if i do n't know anyone , it could still be beneficial i could meet new people and doing so would help me get to know the client and hopefully help my career i would talk to my manager about the feedback i would politely tell my side of the story i would provide evidence and examples to back myself up if my manager did not change his her mind this could be an opportunity to improve for next time i think it would be boring if i am going to learn about a place , i would like to travel there i need to experience things to feel connected , so simply learning at home would not be very exciting
i would see if they could make some accommodations with me somehow this might include asking for preference on the next vacation time it would be a pleasant and non confrontational convesration i would handle a lot of the work ahead of time in case of any unexpected emergencies that way i would n't feel crunched i like to plan ahead i would go because it 's an important opportunity i do n't need a colleague there to feel comfortable i can make connections on my own i would feel anxious i would talk further with my manage to get a better understanding of the feedback i would use that feedback constructively yes , i would love an opportunity like that i love to travel i love to learn about new cultures and places
if my colleague had a family and could n't change their plans and i could , i 'd switch my weeks if i could n't change , i 'd talk to my supervisor for a solution i 'd try to get a jump on everything so if my boss comes up with something , i wo n't be too far behind the worse that can happen is that i finish my project early i 'd ask my colleague to go i would explain my feelings and hope they change their mind if not , i may ask another colleague to go with me i 'd ask my manager where the feedback came from and why they feel that way i 'd also explain why i think the feedback is n't true if it was very conflicting , i would n't mind writing a rebuttal i 'd find it enjoyable i would also hope that if we got the client , i 'd be the person who gets to travel and meet with the client in norway i enjoy learning about different countries and cultures and would be thankful for that opportunity
i would change my plan simply to show the supervisor i am reasonable as well as garner more accolades i will also use this later on when i need to take a day and this happens again i can also use this to my advantage with the colleague as well saying i decided to switch my day off so you could have your vacation still go through with no issue this is not ideal but it certainly allows me to show that i am not only a team player but a company person caring more about the companies needs than my own even if that is not the case besides while that person is away its a perfect opportunity to work harder to make me even more valuable i would take it on with zero complaints i would keep in mind that at a certain point i should expect that my silly boss will add things to that at the last minute knowing this and still accepting the job i am focused to not only expect it but to thrive and make myself an even more successful employee i would go with zero reservations or issues if my silly colleague does not see the gravity of this opportunity oh well to me this is not only a great opportunity to shine a brighter light on my company and it 's benefits but also to make my name more known with the largest client we know this always leads to them talking about you to your boss in this case this is a slam dunk and i would secretly thank my colleague for running scared from such an opportunity i would make it a point to say my peace to him and everyone else in the organization if this goes without being fixed that means my value at this company is not high and that will be known as well i will immediately begin working harder and smarter meaning no more help to colleagues and now everyone will know what i did and how much effort was put in it i will also make it a point to be in another company within 3 months i would find this extremly enjoyable how can one not \? how often am i going to steep myself into another culture and get paid for it this reeps an enormous amount of knowledge and benefit for me not only am i increasing my personal growth but my personal abilities for future employers who knows maybe there will be a short time job in norway
well i would be upset this year we are not going to fl and my husband only has 2 days off so since we will just be staying around home and not leaving it wont be a huge deal to do it adifferent week i will let her have the week she wantsi would go ahead and take a deep brathe and relax go get my notbook and markers and start with my regular to do list for the project starting with what needs done right away i will try to get done afew days ahead so that way i can turn it in early and if my boss has more we can be ahead already i honestly would try to talk my friend into doing this for me and going i would tell her how much this would mean to me and would help me if she still would not go i would go home and put something nice on and go myself make myself known and talk to people i dont really know well i would try to breathe and stay calm i would walk away and think before i spoke then i would come back and sit down with my boss and explain my side and hope they understand and trust me oh this would be fun i think it would be very enjoyable i would love to do the research and find out abut this place find out what they do for fun and for holidays find out about there everyday life this would be so fun
i would try to alter my plans i would also try to understand my coworker 's situation sometimes vacations have to be a certain time to attend an event i think that being willing to change or negotiate would help me look like more of team player i would use what time i have to work on it and not put it off not procrastinating will allow me to be more flexible if there is data that i wo n't get until closer to the due date for the project , i would work around that , and fill in the details closer to the due date i would go i do n't like being in situations when i do n't no anyone , so this would make me very uncomfortable but i see it as an opportunity for me to get to the clients and for them to know me it actually sounds like an great way to build more business for my company i would wait a day or two and then reread the evaluation if i still disagreed with it , i would write out a response , explaining my rationale before i gave it to my manager , i would first ask if s he would be willing to read it or to discuss my evaluation further i would be sure i got very specific feedback , so that it would n't happen again i would love this experience i find other cultures very interesting , and i like to talk to people from other countries and learn about them if i did n't have to travel there for work , i would try to travel there on my own
i would refuse to change my vacation plans , and invent all manner of excuses for why i could not do so if that did n't work i would evaluate my situation and one of two things would happen 1 i would quit right there , with likely a lot of profanity and telling them exactly what i thought of them 2 were my situation desperate i would change my vacation plans , but then my colleague would be marked i would get even with that son of a bitch , one way or another the more i could make them suffer , the better , so long as it ca n't be proven that i was responsible i do not consider my coworkers to be colleagues i consider them to be people that i must tolerate to a degree in order to keep my job and income source i will smile at them , and put up with their stupidity to an extent , but some things are intolerable to me affecting my vacation , my time away from these fools , is one of them ! i would pad out the project 's schedule by creating difficulties wherever i could you know , things can go wrong an unexpected restart can lose all your work a computer crash other important tasks fake injury if desperate it 's important to busy ones self never , ever , let the boss know that your workload is light in all likelihood i would not go if i could get out of it i know all the blah blah blah about how networking is important for advancing one 's career , and it supposedly is not what you know but who you know , but i do not care i am at a job to make money rarely do i enjoy work , and when i am in a situation that i hate , such as being forced to work to acquire money so that i may maintain a standard of living , i cope in part by treating everyone with cold disdain , to the degree i can get away with without being fired it depends on the type of criticism really if they are someone who i actually respected , i would accept their criticism one earns my respect by showing me that they know their stuff , that they are truly a professional with admirable traits i run into very few that fit this category were it someone that i did not respect , then it would depend on my situation if i desperately needed the income , then i would appear to be submissive and accepting of the feedback with promises to do better however my situation would have to be really desperate even then that manager would be marked , and would see me treating them as coldly as i could without getting fired eventually depending on my situation , i would quit when they day came , that manager would get some negative feedback from me , quite a lot of it i would verbally destroy them for every failure and moment of incompetence that i witnessed , and if i got any of it on video i would set out to burn their career my tolerance for fools has lessened as i 've gotten older , and there are too many damn fools out there i would not volunteer period i care nothing about norway , and i do not work at a job to expand my mind i do that on my own time , learning things that i wish to learn it may be that i take an interest in the norwegian culture , but it would be on my own time and by my own motivation trying to force me to learn something will anger me at my last job i literally faked a hearing disability to avoid learning how to use the till so that i would not have to take customer orders i saw no future for myself at that job , so i refused to put in effort that i did not need to
if it were possible for me to exchange my vacation , then i would agree to do so i would be accommodating because i could afford to be if i did n't have any definite plans , i would have no problem taking my vacation at another time i would try to have the project completed early if i knew my boss might give me a last minute project i would do that because it would make things much easier for me and for my boss if i can be accommodating , i am sure my boss will be toward me in the future i would definitely go ! this could be the chance of a lifetime i think my colleague may be missing a great opportunity to represent the company i would check to see whether my manager was correct in his or her facts before i would go off the deep end if my manger was correct , i would make some changes if he or she was not , then i would give him her more feedback i would find the experience enjoyable i would be a great opportunity to teach someone from norway about american customs , etc hopefully i would have an opportunity to visit the client in norway someday
i would most likely take the alternate week , because it 's still vacation and i am usually more flexible than othersi would make a schedule of when things need to be done by to give myself at least a day or two at the end that involves just going over details , which would allow me time for any last minute tasks from the boss i would try to convince my colleague to go with me , maybe point out the relaxed atmosphere and how important networking with this client could be for our company i would probably feel a little deflated , but would try to make a point to ensure my manager saw any corrections i made , or behavior that contradicts the feedback i would find this experience fun , intriguing and rewarding because communicating with people on the other side of the world is just that , exciting
if my plans were flexible , i would change my vacation however , i prefer being pro active , so i would have avoided the situation by checking with my colleagues before scheduling a vacation if that had been the case , i would rely on the fact that i had checked with colleagues before scheduling and the fact that i had scheduled vacation first i would complete the project ahead of time not only would this keep me from having a last minute conflict , it may also impress my boss that i completed the project early i am also motivated by staying busy and marking things off my to do list , so i would prefer to start on the next project anyway i would go and network with the client , but after making an appearance and making sure to be seen , i would leave the event early i know it 's important to interact with the clients , but i also think that one quality connection can mean more than a long evening without a solid connection i would put in extra effort at the event to make up for not staying for the entire evening i would be honest about how i felt i would point out why i did n't agree , but after stating my perspective , i would respect what my manager decides i would make sure that my manager understands that i accept and respect whatever he or she decides and i would express my thanks for allowing me to share my perspective i would say that it depends on what the project is i would find learning about the country and culture enjoyable , not boring but the work itself may be something that i find boring
change my dates and then talk smack about them when they leave fill up in rage there that week while overdosing on black coffee when they come back just stare at them at there cube scope out the requirements and plan to have additional help from staff if the need arises in order to make the due date tell the staff that this is a number one priority when complete on time take the credit go and spend my night at the bar since i'm on a expense account have a goof time with the client then tell my colleague he is a pussy for bailing out of work like that i am filled with rage and depression i go the bar that night complain to total strangers when i get back in the office in the morning i start surfing the web for new jobs boring , norway is a country i could care less about one has to look at the payoff and if there is no bonus in it for me no reason to waste my time got to prioritize what counts at work
i would ask my colleague what it would take to compromise on a solution i would offer splitting the same week off with my colleague i would then ask my supervisor if that was an equitable solution i would propose dates before and after the week as a solution i would write out the tasks that need to be completed i would prioritize tasks for each day i would focus on the specific tasks for the day , and see how much time was left i would then jump in to complete tasks for other days i would try something new and go myself i would think of this as a new opportunity to stretch out of my comfort zone i would go to the meeting and introduce myself to someone new i would ask my boss for a meeting i would ask my boss what i could do to turn the situation around i would then focus on implementing those changes i would find the experience enjoyable because it would give me new opportunities i would learn about a different culture and be exposed to other ways of work i would also have the opportunity to expand my work knowledge and be useful somewhere else
i would see if we would be able to compromise somehow if i was just taking a vacation that was n't booked already , i would change my time and take it at another time if i was taking it and i had things booked , i would n't want to change for obvious reasons i would try to ask the boss if i could find someone to take my place or do my work in extra time before i left to compensate for the missing time or i could do some work remotely while i am on vacation for a few hours to help as soon as i receive the project , i start to work on it i pace myself so that i can have enough time to properly work on it and that i am able to finish on time this way , if my boss gives me last tasks that can take a lot of time , i would still be able to manage everything properly i would still go regardless if my colleague went i do n't have a problem getting along with people and i am friendly enough and outgoing enough not to mind showing up alone i would be able to socialize and meet some new people i am sure i could make it into a positive event i would talk to my manager about it i would give them my side of the situation and i would want to hear their feelings as well i would try not to take it personally so that i do n't overreact to the situation i would try to work things out in my favor i would find this experience enjoyable because i always like to know about other countries and cultures i would like to work with the client because i could learn and gain knowledge and experience that i might not be able to have otherwise i think that it would be interesting and exciting
i would ask my manager if it was possible for him or her to hire a temp if they said no , then i would ask them to see who put in for the vacation first i think it would only be fair to give it to the person who asked firsti would ask my boss if there was anyway i could have some assistance i would then ask if not , if he would n't put any more workload on me i would then ask if he could make me a promise to all of that i would ask my colleague if they could possible go for a hr or 2 at the most if they said no i would possibly go alone i would try to mingle the best i could i would ask my manager if we could sit down and talk about the situation i would ask my manger why they thought i got negative feedback i would explain my point of view and hope that they would come up with a solution i would find it very enjoyable i would think that it would make the workdays go by faster i think learning about my projects country would be very interesting
i would first see who put in for vacation first if i put in for it first i will just simply let them know that i have already made arrangements and paid for my vacation i would suggest that my colleague rethink his time i would get the project done it does n't matter that my load is light i have a job to do and because my boss it is full of surprises i would make sure that i would have time for this project and whatever else he lays on me i would go i would go because this is one of my biggest clients and that is going to be my main focus if my colleague does not want to go so i 'll have somebody to socialize with then i will just have to meet new people you never know what happens unless you take a chance i would request a one on one meeting with my manager to find out why i got such a negative review from them then we would discuss how to flip it into a positive and if it 's something that i 've actually done wrong i would make sure i know and be wiser the next time i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i love learning new things and about new cultures this would give me the opportunity to not only work on a project that i want to work on but also learn about something that i have no clue about always a conversation starter
i would take my vacation at a different time then i desire peace at work so i would try to seek a compromise with my colleague , gaining a preference for time at a later date i see no reason not to be adult about the situation i would approach my boss and ask if any surprises are waiting around the corner i would explain the time frame i am looking at i believe we can reasonably work out this situation i would explain i want to do my best work but need some warning to do that i would go anyway i see no need to miss an opportunity just because i do n't know anyone that seems immature to me i would like to seize every chance that comes my way i would request a meeting with my manager and present my case i would rely on evidence on the meeting , not emotion if i ca n't convince my manager of an error , then i would have to think about taking the matter up the ladder i would definitely find this an enjoyable experience i have lived abroad a good deal and value learning about other cultures and countries i could imagine few better opportunities i would definitely seek the chance to expand what i know of the world
i would first talk to my colleague to see what they have going on during that week i would do this to see if either of us has something that can be cancelled we both need to be reasonable if nothing can be agreed upon , i would agree to let them go ahead and use that week , as i do not like disagreements i would go ahead and start to work on the project i do n't like last minute things that need to be done i also do n't like to complete things in a hurry because i would have less of a chance to check for mistakes it is best that when the workload is light to go ahead and work on some of a person up and coming work and leave some leeway for extra things that may come up i would go ahead and attend the meeting they are one of our largest clients , so i need to be there it does not matter that i do n't know anyone there , the client comes first and foremost i would go and put on my best social skills get to know my clients as well as others better it will be good for the company i would go over the feedback that is given to me by my manager i would analyze what is said and those things that i do n't feel to be true , i would prepare a presentation to show different it would make me feel terrible especially since the feedback does not seem to carry any weight as to anything that i see that i have done wrong i would find that the experience would be enjoyable it would give me a chance to do research on a new culture this project would also give me a chance to maybe get end on some high end deals and give me more exposure in a positive light by showing initiative
i would suggest that we see who requested the vacation first then the first person would get it and the second would have to reschedule theirs i would go to my boss and ask for them to prioritize the tasks for me if something last minute comes up and i am still working on the project , i would ask for clarification on which tasks to complete first i would also asks for deadlines on each task i would encourage them to go but if they do not go , i would still go to the meeting this could be a perfect chance for me to make valuable connections with a large client unfortunately , i would probably not really say anything i would just have to take the feedback and hope that i could improve enough to be able to receive my bonus i think that i would be willing to be on the project it would be interesting to learn more about other cultures but i would not want to be involved in the project if i had to travel i do not like to travel and would not like to leave my family
i would try and negotiate with both my supervisor and colleague if for some reason they could n't find a replacement for me for that time , i guess i will be forced to change my plans although , i do n't want to have to do that , but maybe my supervisor would think that i am a flexible employee i would try and get as much of that project done early as i could i would use my time wisely , just incase something does come up and my boss needs me for something else there is no sense in wasting company time if my workload is light and i am not taking advantage of that time at first i would try my hardest to convince my colleague to go with me and not leave me not knowing anyone however , i guess if they do n't go , i should go ahead and go and make myself presentable and get my name out there of course , i could just end up going home , but i am sure my boss would want me to go however i would confront my manager and ask why they gave me negative feedback and what i could do to change it i would try and negotiate with them and let them know what was at stake if they went ahead gave the negative review as well , i would go to my big boss and let them know what is going on and see if they could provide suggestions i would find it enjoyable the chance to have something of my own that i could bring to my company would be a great challenge i think learning of the culture and what it has to offer would open doors to possibly visiting some day
i would suggest that the first one of us to request the vacation days gets the vacation time i would assess the reason we both want vacations and see which is more valid and less movable i would consult our supervisor and make them make the decision based on what i wrote earlier i would take the time off if it were approved and i needed the time off unless the coworker had a strong reason to take off and i had a weak reason and the rescheduling of my vacation would not cause me undue hardship unless compensated by the organizationi would do as much work as i could as soon as possible there is no reason to put it off doing so could create a conflict where one necessary task doesnt get done and if i put in a heavy workload this week i can take a light week next week i encourage my colleague to go and buy them a soda or coffee to pop them up if they dont go , i go alone i would put extra effort into making connections using our mutual relationship with my colleague as a jumping off point i feel pissed off i go through my records to provide proof that the feedback is unjustified and contest the evaluation if the unjust negative feedback is kept , i immediately start exploring other employment opportunities as this is clearly an attempt to lay down cause for my eventual firing i would love to take this experience i would enjoy learning new skills and meeting new people in a new place all on the company 's time and dime i would enjoy the change from my usual schedule because i like working vacations
i would find out from the supervisor who asked for the vacation first if they asked first i would change my vacation to a different week if they asked for it first i would change my vacation and also ask for priority to schedule my vacation the next time if we both asked at the same time i would hope that the employee with the most seniority would get the week i would get the project started and finished as quickly as possible that is because my boss is unpredictable and he she could assign me new work at any time i would hopefully be able to get the project done before another project dropped on my lap i would push myself to go i would struggle with the decision by ultimately i know that by going and pushing myself to socialize , talk and mingle would be good for me and my career i think i would be real proud of myself for going alone i would feel devastated and angry i know i put a lot of work and effort in my work and do n't deserve the negative feedback i would give a few hours or day and i would go back to my manager and talk it through again i would try and find out where the problem misunderstanding lies and i would work to rectify it i would find it very enjoyable and i would love to do it i love to travel and learn about other countries and their cultures i would learn as much as i could and then later talk to the client about what i had learned if this eventually resulted in a trip to norway i would love it !
i would hopefully be able to change mine if i had nonrefundable tickets though there may be a battle with my coworker maybe try to convince the boss he could live without both of us for the week i would keep up on the workload , completing as soon as possible by doing this i would hope to have enough time if the boss gave last minute task if not i would have to work extra hours to complete it i would go to the meeting networking is an important part of our business and chance not to be missed i possibly could meet more people if i did n't have my colleague there to lean on i would feel rather upset if i truly believe it was unjust i would try to have a conversation with my boss about it and to get some understanding if that did n't work may go higher up if it 's an option i would find the experience enjoyable i would love to learn about norway in an interesting way i would rather travel to norway to learn though
i would first ask my colleague if their vacation had any special occasion if it did not then i would ask about their vacation and ask why this particular week it has to be if they have no significant reason then i would ask my supervisor who requested off first for vacation i think if there is no special occasion involved then the one who first requested should get it i would start the project immediately i would do this so that i could have the project done early and well way ahead of schedule thus is my boss gives me last minute tasks then i would have significant time to complete extra work i would also while working on project try to anticipate what my bosses last minute work and see if i can prepare what i would need to do that work and have what i could ready if needed i would do my very best to convience my colleague to go with me i would tell them why i wanted them to go so that i knew someone and it would be more comfortable for me i would also tell them that i would be so very grateful if they could do me this favor i would also let them know that i would n't make them stay too long and i would be indebted to them for the gesture i would feel both hurt and a bit angry i would first approach my manager calmly and ask to please speak to them in private about why they gave me the evaluation if i did n't think that they gave me a valid reason then i would set up a time to meet with their supervisor i would find this experience enjoyable i believe i enjoy learning about new things it would be interesting learning about the people , culture and environment i'm sure i would learn some fascinating facts
i would be willing to change my plans and use my vacation at a different time if i did n't have any specific plans for vacation such as taking a trip if that is not possible i would suggest going by whomever has more seniority and been there the longest should get first dibs that is the only fair way to decide i would get this project finished right away that way i wo n't have to worry about it and if my boss gives me other tasks that will take a lot of time i can focus on just one task i do n't like to put off tasks till the last minute because you never know what else may come up i would definetly go without them it could be very good for my career even though i will not know anyone there it would be a great time to meet new people that could help further my career i would feel upset and angry that i received negative feedback that i did not deserve even thought i disagree with this feedback i would still try to make improvements with my self and in my work maybe i could actually learn something about myself in the process that i was not aware of before i think this would very enjoyable it would be interesting to learn about a new culture and its people to better understand my client it may even inspire me to want to visit that country someday
i would find out who asked for the vacation time first and go with that if either one of us had a very important function to attend , it would be proper for the other to change dates the only fair way , in all other cases , would be to give it to the person who requested it first i would continue working on my project as much as i could to get it completed it does n't make any difference when it 's done as long as it 's done on time that way , i would be ready for anything else that might come my way via my boss i would still go and just deal with not knowing anyone it would give me a good opportunity to get to know others it would be nicer if my colleague went but it is not a major problem i would write down everything i felt was wrong with the feedback i would ask to sit down with my manager and talk about it i would definitely ask him her to reconsider the feedback as it is detrimental to my work record i would , of course , give them the reasons why it should be reconsidered i would find it absolutely enjoyable i would be the first to volunteer it is always interesting to learn about other countries , their customs and cultures
i would change my vacation week , because i am a better employee than he or she we ca n't both be off work at the same time because then the other people at work would suffer because of our selfishness also , the other employee or even my boss now kind of owes me i would reach out to my boss and ask him or her what i needed to get started on this project i would begin this project ahead of time , since my boss is gonna add crap onto it anyways hopefully it will be earlier if i show him her my results i would not go i am a not a social person i do n't do well in any crowds i get social anxiety i would ask my manager why he she gave me such feedback but although i may not agree with it and not believe it 's true , maybe i am in the wrong i would ask my manager what i needed to do to correct the wrong if everything is bs though , and i hate the job , i may just quit i would find this experience super enjoyable i love learning different cultures and languages \( i have a minor in japanese \) i would devote a lot of time studying up about norway , and even ask my company to send me there if the opportunity arises
i would change it unless they have been on vacation more recently than i have , i would message them about my upcoming projects in order to hopefully stave those off for a little longer i would try my best to think of ways to make the meeting go as best as possible , even if they do n't arrive not really sure how to handle this one refusing to accept what he wrote could result in an argument but then accepting it not saying anything could make me feel as if i did n't address it properly i think it would be awesome the one thing that would make me nervous is just the language barrier even still , could be fun
i would basically go with the first come , first serve mentality if my co worker had put in for it first , i 'd delete my request , and put in for a different date but if i had put in the request first , i would meet with my supervisor \( and probably co worker \) to discuss my thoughts and reasons for not being willing to budge i would get to work on the project right away , and try to get it near finalized asap once i felt good about where it stands , i would turn my attention to any other tasks that came up as the deadline approached , i would update it , and add anything that i thought necessary to polish it up i would still go because it would show my dedication to work it would also show others that i'm willing to go the extra mile , and take my work serious , which i think would help down the line as far as promotions , etc go most work days are fairly long , so that should n't be a factor , as there is still adequate time \( weekends , holidays , vacation days , etc \) to unwind and relax i would discuss it at length with my manager , and get his or her reasoning as to why i got the negative feedback if i believe he was accurate i would ask if there is anyway to remedy it as to not lose my bonus if i did n't agree , i 'd plead my case , and if he or she would n't listen , i would take it up to a manager above them i would find this very enjoyable , as i have little experience with much diversity living in small town usa i would happily embrace the opportunity to learn about a new culture , and go all in on it i would do anything necassary to get acclimated , and likely do much research online , and find someone from the area to bounce things off of \( ie differences in our cultures \) i think it would be beneficial for myself as well as others , and i would enjoy it greatly
i would sit down with this fellow employee and ask him her why they cannot change their plans i would also explain why it 's so important for me to be able to take my vacation lastly , i would speak with my wife about potentially changing our vacation plans i would finish the project as soon as possible i would anticipate that my boss would come up with new tasks and or have me modify some things about the project i would not want to take the chance of not being able to finish the project i would still go because it would still be a good idea to network i would also go because this way i could form my own first impression of people without my colleague being there i would also go because being there without my colleague may give me an advantage if ever we were to be in competition for a promotion i feel offended by this situation i would try to show through my actions that i can be responsive to my boss 's feedback i would not try to change my boss 's mind nor prove to him her that they are wrong i would find this experience to be enjoyable because i would be paid to learn something plus , learning about the country does not mean that i would not be asked to travel there sometime in the future it could also give me the opportunity to get leadership experience because i would help educate my coworkers on what i learn as the project continues
i would act depending on what my plans were if i had something booked that was non refundable , for instance , i would let my coworker know and see if we could work it out somehow if i had an open week with no plans , i would have no problem with giving that particular week to my colleague and rescheduling my vacation time i would begin to work on this project right now i personally do not enjoy having a large load on me with little time since i have the time now , i do n't see why i would n't begin work on it i actually find it to be an advantage to have the time to start on it now , that way i have enough time to really think it through and execute it the best way that i possibly can i would remind my colleague of the bigger picture let them know how important this client is to our firm , and how it will be fun once we arrive , on top of the networking benefits i would let them know that they are a valuable part of the team , and there presence there along with mine would be an amazing representation of our company i would encourage them as a friend , as well as a colleague i would feel really awful and conflicted in this situation depending on the severity of the situation , i may stick up for myself if need be , and try to compromise with my boss however , if it is something minor , i might just mention that that was not my intention , i was n't aware that i was performing in that way , suck it up , and move on i would absolutely find this to be an enjoyable experience having never been to norway , i would learn so much on top of being able to see it , even if i do n't do anything but work on the project furthermore , i would have the opportunity to build international work relationships this sounds like a great opportunity for everyone , involving work , growth , and adventure
i would confer with my colleague on the plans we both made in regards to our perspective vacations i would like to see if plans were set in stone on either side \( i e airfare , hotel room , or any travel related costs \) if he she is already committed financially and i have some flexibility then i would have no problem altering my dates for vacation for another time if my dates are financially committed as well , then i would as our supervisor to make the decision , probably based on seniority on who goes on what days , i would complete as much of my regular workload as possible and keep in communication with boss on the possibility of any potential new projects additions that may come up by constantly communicating with him her , i would hope that they would try to give me the work as soon as it occurs , so i would n't feel a need to rush in order to complete it i would try to persuade my colleague to attend the meeting with me if i'm unable to persuade my colleague , then i would try to get as much information about the client from my colleague that i may be aware of this information would at least make sure that when i engage with the client , that i seem knowledgeable on their company and or personnel i would very negatively about receiving the feedback from my supervisor i would ask that my supervisor and i get a chance to sit down and meet on why he she felt that way during the time of feedback i would want to discuss in detail on how why my supervisor came to that conclusion also to state my side of things in reference to being in disagreement with his her thoughtsi would find this to be a very enjoyable situation i like having the opportunity to learn about new things especially to be able to learn about new cultures and places that are different , but may be the same in some ways from where i live while being able to travel there would be great , but the process of learning more about them on my own and the potential to converse with them , would be good as well
i would try to discuss it with my co worker i would give him my point of view so that he might be willing to change dates if that is not possible i would suck it up and try to make another date work for me i would want to know who requested time off first i would come up with a plan for how long i want the project to take i would try to complete it within the week i would set aside some time each day solely for the assignment i would not wait until the last minute i would feel hesitant about going i would try to psyche myself up about going and meeting the client i 'd go alone and try to present my best ideas to the client i 'd try to think of it as a wise career move i would take some time to think about it rationally , rather than emotionally i would wait until the next day and request a private meeting with my boss to state my concerns i 'd gather any information that may help my case it would be my number one priority and i would n't feel happy if he manager does n't hear me out i would love to learn more about norway it 's the kind of think i'm personally interested in it would be good for my reputation with higher ups and make me look good it would give me one up among other co workers
i would let them have that vacation date i feel like if i do something for that colleague right now maybe in the future they will return the favor i think that in doing this kind deed , good karma will come back to me i believe that it is good to be flexible in life sometimes i would front load the project i would organize my time very wisely and complete most of the work in the earlier weeks and give my self some extra time in my schedule if something else were to pop up so i can complete the work to the best of my ability i would make sure to keep my calendar very organized and make sure that i do not procrastinate i would attend the meeting with the large client just because my friend is not going does not mean i wont go either i think going shows my dedication to my job and having the opportunity to work with one of the largest clients is n't an opportunity i will pass up for anyone i would definitely try to see the situation in the eyes of mt manager i would then talk to them in a meeting and ask them about the feedback they gave me i think that this talk is a good starter to making sure that my job is secure talking through the feedback with the manager would make me feel better i would find this experience to be enjoyable i think that learning about another culture and country will be interesting and make the work more fun i would like to travel as a part of the project so that i would be able to get a physical feel of the country for myself i think learning about the country would elevate the project
i would keep with my plans if i had already requested them before that person i would probably switch the dates if i had n't already gotten an approval just to help the company out if the people i am going on vacation with ca n't switch then i would make sure i told my supervisor that other people in my party have already put in for those dates and ca n't switch , so i would not switch i would start working on the project as soon as possible to get a lot done early on i would make sure that i had most of the work done just before hand so that way if my boss were to give me something else to do , i would n't feel like i was neglecting the original project if i started to leave like i was n't get to get the project done in time because of the extra work load then i would ask a colleague to help me out with the new tasks i would still go to the networking meeting because of the client that will be there i would not want to miss an opportunity to get better acquainted with this client or any others that might be there i might try to get my colleague to really change their mind by telling them all the positives about going to the meeting and treat them to a stop at the coffee house before hand i would feel absolutely terribly about this situation i would try to have a sit down with my manager and see why i got the negative feedback i would see if there was anything i could do to change the feedback , see if there was anything i could work on to make it better i would jump at the chance to work on on the project i think that experiencing a new culture would be a wonderful adventure for me to get involved in it would be a great opportunity to feel like i was part of a bigger world and have fun doing it
i would probably let my colleague take that time i usually do not go anywhere on vacation , so it would n't be that big of a deal as long as i got another week off , i would be good i would , to be honest , probably wait to complete the project closer to the due date i tend to work better at the last minute because then i do n't overthink things working on it too early would probably stress me out more because i would question everything and overthink my responses last minute , for me , is better , even if the boss throws in some last minute work i would , like my colleague , not want to go the meeting , but unlike my colleague , i would probably go i hate networking , but i understand some sacrifices would need to be made i would have to put on my best face and act like i was trying to win an oscar , but i would probably suck it up i would fight for myself and ask for a better explanation so i could understand how my manager came to the conclusions he or she did i would really try to understand and take the advice to heart , but i admit , i would be offended but if my bonus was at stake , i would just fight for what i can and take my licks when i have to i would jump at this opportunity ! i love to learn new things , especially new things about different cultures and countries i read the encyclopedia and browse wikipedia for fun , so this would be awesome for me
i would ask the colleague if they were doing anything important for their vacation if they did not have major plans i would ask them if they would n't mind changing their week and i would promise that the following vacation pick i would do the same for them if they were doing something important and i was not i would just concede the vacation to them i would start this project immediately i would put away more time in the first few days to avoid any issues later on this way if some other last minute task came up , i would still be prepared i would ask my colleague to do me a personal favor and to go i would tell them that i will not spend a lot of time at the meeting and i will leave early with them i will remind them that this will be good for our company and will make us look better in front of our boss i would feel extremely frustrated in this situation i would not answer back to my boss immediately , instead return home rafter work and really give my rebuttal deep though i would then write a carefully written , well thought , professional letter explaining my argument and hand it to the boss the following day i would find this experience enjoyable i think this would be a change of pace from the normal routine work experience i would be excited to learn about a different country and culture and also get to meet a new client
i would see if my plans were able to be changed if they were n't , i would fight to keep the vacation i would n't back down i would start the project as soon as possible i would n't start reducing my effort until i had a good grip on it i would try to give my manager updates prior to completion i would try to encourage my colleague to go if my colleague bailed , i would probably decide not to go i would n't want to go somewhere without knowing anyone i would talk with my manager i would try to get their vantage point if that did n't work , i would try to talk to someone above my manager i would find the experience enjoyable it 's fun to learn about new things and face new challenges i would be good at it
i would first try to understand the situation fully , finding out why my coworker cannot change their plans and what exactly my supervisor 's concerns were , so that i do not assume incorrectly i would then discuss options with both my supervisor and colleague for instance , i would ask my supervisor if i could work remote for a few hours on vacation to help with the workload , allowing both me and my coworker to go on vacation i would also ask my coworker if they would be willing to work some hours while on vacation to help with the supervisor 's concerns worst comes to worst , i would change my vacation plans , i'm sure that there would be serious reasons for both my coworker and supervisor to be inflexible i would discuss with my boss any tasks that he sees upcoming , so that i can attempt to prepare for these tasks i would also work ahead on the project so that i have time for last minute tasks other than working ahead , i would just mentally prepare myself to work a little bit later for a couple of days to give the extra tasks and the project all the time necessary to make sure that they are perfect i would try to convince my coworker to go , enthusiastically listing off all the benefits of going to the networking meeting , particularly hanging out with me , their wonderful coworker i would also invite other coworkers to accompany us , so that hopefully we could have a large , fun group attend if neither of these plans worked out , i would still attend the networking meeting as it will present an opportunity to grow , improve , and reaffirm my relationship with the large client i think my initial reaction would be to be angry and annoyed , though i would thank my supervisor for the feedback i would take a day and think about the feedback he gave me and discuss it with other people \( without naming the source of the feedback \) to get their insights i think that any negative feedback is valuable , as there must be some truth in it even if i believe it is not accurate , it is important to realize that i am being perceived in a way that is different from reality after taking time to calm down and think critically about the feedback , i would approach my boss to discuss my disagreements with the feedback in a logical , non combative fashion i would absolutely thrilled to be paid for this experience i think learning in general is valuable , but i would be especially interested if there is a chance to travel and engage with what i am learning about i would definitely be the first to volunteer !
i would not be willing to change my vacation plans either i would ask another colleague to work my shift so that it would be covered i don t think it is fair that i d have to change my plans because my colleague scheduled their vacation plans the same time as me i would try to prioritize my work to see how i can be efficient with getting the project done if needed , i would enlist the help of my colleague to delegate some work to them this way , i would be able to complete all tasks on time i would still go even if my coworker doesn t attend i would attend because the meeting could be an opportunity to network and meet new people also by going to the meeting , i would show my colleague that i m a team player i would not feel good about the situation i would request my manager to provide me with information about the negative feedback i received i would want to know how i could improve and make a case as to why i should still be eligible to receive an annual bonus i would find it enjoyable because i love learning about different cultures i could possibly learn to speak simple phrases in norwegian , which could impress the clients learning about new countries and cultures helps to make me a well rounded person
i would let my colleague go on vacation that week if he goes on vacation , others will see that i am a selfless person and am willing to sacrifice my interests for the company my supervisor will take note of this and he or she will see me in a more positive light i would try to finish it as soon as possible because things always come up these disturbances can cause me to miss the deadline i also hate the feeling of hastily completing something without refining the end product i would initially be hesitant about going but would eventually realize that the event would be helpful i believe that meeting the right people is as important as working long hours i would suck it up and go to the event with an open mind i would have a private conversation with my manager i would listen to his reasons for giving me negative feedback while i would be open to listening to his side , i would also state my opinion about my performance and hope that he would reverse his evaluation i would be glad to volunteer for the project i love traveling and learning more about different cultures the experience would also result in both personal and professional growth
i would seek to change my own plans i'm generally not confrontational and would attempt to avoid disagreement if this would not work , i would possibly try to find someone to cover my shift , if acceptable i would attempt to outline what needed to be done with the task to structure work i would also attempt to complete work in advance to avoid being late on the project this way , i could complete the longer term task in the most relaxed way possible i would encourage my colleague to go , even for a short moment by making an appearance at least , we would stand a better chance of impressing the client if my colleague refused to go , i would still likely attend the event on my own i would carefully examine the feedback and gauge how accurate it is if it is factually inaccurate , i would gather counter evidence and present an argument that the feedback was mistaken if it was accurate , i would attempt to outline how i would avoid similar performance in the future i would find the experience enjoyable , as i generally enjoy learning new things and taking on challenging projects however , i would be wary about the possible adjustment to different social norms when interacting with the client i would thus take the assignment very seriously to ensure that the company was not embarrassed
first , i would see i there would be any way i could reschedule my vacation week if i can , then i would and let my colleague have that vacation week if i ca n't , i would talk to my colleague and see if we can work something out if not , the last resort would be both of us going to the supervisor and having them decide i would work on it a little each day i would prioritize my tasks and in between task , just chip away at the project that way if i do receive a last minute significant task or tasks , i should hopefully be done or close to completing the project i would still go , but probably not stay long it would be uncomfortable not knowing anyone there however , i would be willing to show the client i appreciate being invited to the networking meeting i would be upset however , i do n't think i would press the issue with my manager just in case it would make the situation worse i would just come to terms with it , and whatever happens , happens i would find this experience enjoyable i believe it 's a great thing to learn about other countries and cultures i also would n't mind traveling at all either
i would speak to my colleague and let them know that since they are unwilling to change their vacation plans this time , that next time i should get priority scheduling and that they would need to be more flexible i would also alter my vacation plans this time so as not to overload my other colleagues i would then inform my boss about what my coworker and i were planning for the next time vacation planning comes up i would begin the project early so as to balance out my workload and to not be overloaded with any last minute tasks that my boss may give near the project deadline i would also make sure to create to do lists to keep track of what work i would have to complete i would go to the networking meeting anyways i would fill my colleague in on what happened in the meeting afterwards as well i would be sure to acquaint myself with people at the meeting and make connections despite not knowing anyone at the meeting i would speak to my manager about what the negative feedback concerned i would ask what brought that feedback about and how i could improve my performance i would also ask how i could improve in the feedback area i would find this experience enjoyable because i would get to teach a foreign person about american culture furthermore , i will get to learn about norwegian culture by speaking to this person i would take them around the city and show them popular areas and tourist locations
i would try to speak to my colleague again i would try to see if we could reach a compromise about the vacation time perhaps , i would suggest that we split the week , so one person could take half of the week and the other , the other half if this did not work i would speak to my manager to see the next best option i would start the project immediately if my workload was light , i do not see a reason to not start the project plus , the sooner i start the project the sooner i will finish and can avoid issues in the event that my boss gives me unexpected work i would go to the event anyways i would see the event as an opportunity to get to know my other coworkers and to network plus , going without someone i know forces me outside of my comfort zone i would try to speak to the manager one on one to discuss the feedback more thoroughly i would express my opinions and seek and constructive criticism that they might offer i would be frustrated but would see it as a chance to grow i would find this experience exhilarating ! i would be eager to have a chance to travel and learn about a new country and culture , for work it would be an opportunity for great professional and personal growth
this would really depend on the reason i would need the vacation time off if there was something that was important happening like a family event , i would pressure my boss into deciding based on need for time off if it was just for a trip or something i could change , then i would be willing to change the time i needed off i would work at my usual pace to avoid making mistakes if my boss throws something at me last minute i would then rush that and if the quality suffers then i would have a reason but i wouldnt want my main project suffering i would still go and possibly take my spouse if he were available this a great opportunity to grow my career the fact that my colleague wasnt there is even better because it would make me look more professional and go getter i would feel very upset i would take time to calm myself down and then write a professional letter rebutting the negative feedback i would make sure to have someone else read this to be sure that i made my point professionally i would find this very exciting i would want to travel if possible learning about new cultures always interests me and i would love to be involved in a project like this
i would discuss with my colleague about the reasons why they want those specific days for vacation and i would try to compromise with them on letting them have some of those days and keep the rest for myself of course if i do n't have any particular reasons to take my vacation on that week , i could just let them have it i would try to do the most difficult things first in order to ensure finishing the project on time even if i have to do extra work i would try to advance as much as possible to have it ready in case something else comes up i would try to convince my colleague to go so i could meet important people i would point out to them that it 's important that we attend because we were invited by an important client i would do this because i really do n't want to go alone , but if my colleague insists on not going , i would have to go alone i 'd feel very bad about the situation and a little angry for not doing my job well it 's possible i would think my manager is exaggerating but i 'd still feel like it was my fault and i need to do everything to correct it i would become more focused in my job and try not to commit mistakes that lead to another negative review i would not be interesting in forming part of the project although i 'd like to learn more about norway , i would n't like to do it because it 's my job but instead because i enjoy it and because i do n't feel like learning anything at this moment , i think i would pass
it would depend on a few things who had more seniority , who put the time in first , and who had someone to cover then while absent so it depends on those factors well since the boss does it all the time , then i would expect it i would try to be prepared and have my schedule open for the unexpected workload if it is n't mandatory i would n't go but im not a very social person , so i probably would avoid it regardless of the other employee anyways i would probably ask if i could talk to the manager and then explain why the negative feedback is incorrect i would be ok with something like that i would be learning something new i do n't like flying so the not traveling is ok with me
i would change my plans my vacations are usually randomly planned and somewhat close to home this would make it easier for me to move my vacation i would get a good start on the project , but i would not stress about getting it all done immediately i would plan it out over the next few weeks that way if i got extra work , i would have time to do it all i would not go because i have social anxiety i would feel very awkward there by myself i would feel better if i had someone else there that i knew i would talk to my boss about what they said i would possibly go over their head to their boss if i felt they were being unfair i would also have a coworker back me up if need be i would definitely enjoy this project ! i like learning about other cultures and i think it would be not only fun for me , but it would expand my mind i would feel good about myself helping with this project
i would change my vacation week in addition , i 'd suggest to the supervisor that going forward , it might be a good idea for people in their department to submit vacation requests in advance , and these would have to be approved this way , the supervisor could determine the scheduling of vacations and avoid a situation where somebody who had already made travel arrangements would have to cancel and reschedule their plans i would push forward full steam on the project my goal would be to finish it as early and as quickly as possible this way , if my boss gave me additional jobs , i 'd be freed up by having finished the project you never know what could come up and it 's always a good plan to prepare for the unexpected i would go to the meeting there are several reasons for my decision maintaining good relationships with clients is very important i would approach this meeting as an opportunity to expand my sphere of influence and also to learn something i did n't know before if i did n't know anyone there , i would try to strike up conversations with people and introduce myself i would have a one on one meeting with my manager obviously , i'm not happy about the feedback at the meeting , i 'd express my concern that they felt the need to give me negative feedback i 'd ask them questions about specifics of the feedback and try to get clarifications explanations i 'd try to see things from their point of view and be open minded i would volunteer because i 'd see this as a unique opportunity to learn about norway and its culture it 's always a goal of mine to learn something i did n't know before from the time i was a child , why has been a very important word , and i tend to be curious about a wide variety of things i think i 'd find the experience enjoyable
i would change my vacation date because my colleague is unwilling to change his it won t be a big deal i will take the week after for vacation if my colleague is rigid on this small matter , then i should not fight iti would start the project at once even though my workload is small , i would want this project out of the way as soon as possible just in case i get other tasks , i wouldn t want too much on my plate in a short amount of time i would go to see what i could get from this networking meeting it s always nice to meet new people also you never know what will happen until you try it out you could find a great opportunity here and that s what i believe i have nothing to lose i would not feel good about this situation at all i would go up to my manager and see if there was anything i could do to improve my performance i would also explain why i deserve a better performance rating i would do anything to aid my bonus i would find the experience enjoyable because it would be a lot different from my usual things i would volunteer and try to learn new things i don t know much about norway but it would be nice to learn learning can lead to great experiences
i would try and make changes with my family first if i was able to change my vacation , then i would not have a problem switching at work i think this would help my coworker not feel bad as well i would get started on the project right away knowing that i could have to take on extra work during the two weeks until it is due , makes me want to start on it if something does come up , then i will be more prepared i would try and get my colleague to go by explaining how important it is to network i would tell them that i know we have had a long day but it will be worth it in the long run to attend i would try and explain myself i would explain that i do n't believe i deserve the negative feedback and that i am a good employee i would say how i am an asset to the organization as well i would find this experience helpful and a bit interesting i think i would be motivated by work , but then enjoy some of the learning i would do i think i would be good at this task
i would first consider if i could easily swap out my vacation dates if i could change my vacation without it negatively impacting my family then i would just change the dates because it reduces conflict if it would negatively impact my family then i would explain the situation to my co worker and see if we could work out a deal i would try to work out a deal because the co worker might be more flexible with at least a few days if they understood the constraints i had as well i would immediately begin working on the project because i am responsible and manage my time wisely better to get it done while i have time , so when i get time consuming work i wo n't have to work late to get everything completed it is about managing your time i would briefly attend and make an excuse as to why i have to leave early i would also try to convince my colleague to go as well by coercing them with a drink or lunch you have to go it is really not an option to stand up your largest client , but there are ways to show up and leave quietly i would gather up all my supporting evidence for my point of view i would type a letter referencing my evidence politely and ask for a reconsideration of the negative feedback because sometimes manager do n't see everything that is happening at work if the manager was still unwilling to take another look at my evaluation i would contemplate either going to the next level or going to another place of employment that values the skills i bring to the table i would find the experience enjoyable and i would really try to convince them to let me take a trip to the country i thoroughly enjoy learning about other countries and cultures it would break up the monotony of work it would be so fun
i would meet with my colleague and discuss their vacation plans to understand how invested they were in the certain week for example , had they already made flight purchases and it was for a special family getaway i would shift my plans to another week i would begin on the project right away and complete as much as possible long before the due date that would ensure i have time to revise and to ask for advice if needed i would attend the gathering regardless of the choice of my colleague my success in the firm counts on securing the confidence and trust of the client by showing up and taking the time to meet with them i demonstrate my professionalism i would feel very upset and uncomfortable in this situation i would take the time to revisit the scenario and consider the feedback and ask my manager to elaborate further if i continued to disagree i may meet with human resources if i feel i am being discriminated against i would find this experience very enjoyable and interesting i am a bit of a pbs and documentary nerd anyway so this would fit my curious mind perfectly the time and attention learning about the country and culture improves my mind and may benefit me in the future
i would try to reason with them as i would like the vacation as well if we cannot split the time then i would try to work out a way where i would be able to take off during the holiday months instead i would try to tackle the project as soon as possible i like being able to get everything done ahead of time in case there are any issues that come up especially if my boss would assign me tasks that might take a bit of time last minute i would want them to go but if they did not then i would understand i would go to the networking meeting but try to find something that i would enjoy talking about or know a lot about i would not feel as out of place then i would want to talk to them in person and see why they gave me the rating that they did i would also bring in their boss as part of the meeting if possible in a second meeting if the outcome is not what i was wanting i would find this experience enjoyable i would like to learn more about norway and be able to connect with our new client anything that is different or outside the ordinary is something i would be interested in
i would just go along to get along and reschedule my vacation on a different week to me it would n't be a big deal and to avoid conflict with my employer and fellow employee i would change the date i would talk to my boss and explain to him it 's alright and that i will work the week my other colleague is away on vacation plus it 'd probably make me look like a better employee than arguing about it i would work as hard and diligent as i possibly could to finish the project as soon as possible i would do this just in case a major problem arose or i was given more tasks at the last minute doing this would ensure better quality and that i'm able to finish my work properly i would still attend the networking meeting and do my best to meet people and be presentable for my company jobs in which you have clients it 's very important to attend these types of functions since it 's one of our largest clients it 'd be extremely important to me to go so that i would n't give a bad impression to our client i would feel bad about this situation and it would worry me some i would take the negative feedback and do my best to try and make sure that i can correct what 's wrong even if i did n't believe it to be true i would continue working as hard as i could and doing the job to the best of my ability i would find it highly enjoyable because i love to learn about other cultures not only would it be enjoyable to me but it would be fascinating and a great chance to learn about norwegians also because this is a client with my company i would want to work on this so i can be the best employee possible and that to me is n't boring at all
as long as it did not affect my family , i would just let them have that week if it did affect my family , i would talk to them about it i would see how changing would effect them and me , and who is affected more i would get the project done as soon as i can that way , if my boss does give me more at the last second i am already finished with the original project it gives me a better chance at success i would ask them to go i would see if they had something else going on or just did n't want to go i would tell them that i need their support i would be very upset i would go and talk with my supervisor i would see why i received those ratings and see what i could do to improve and change things i would think it would be fun as long as i did n't have to travel i would enjoy learning about another culture i would like to increase my knowledge
i would first find out who requested vacation first i believe whomever put in their request first should have priority if the requests were put in at exactly the same time , i would talk to my colleague to see if we could determine who would have the bigger burden \( ie greater cost , others have schedule vacation times to coordinate \) if we could not reach an agreement based on that , i would find an unbiased third party to review the facts and make a decision as to who should have to defer i would start on my project right away knowing my manager may throw something else at me my focus while my workload was light would be to complete this project then i 'll have some buffer time if needed i think that will allow me to be successful i would not want to go , but i would attending is respectful to this client , and not attending is disrespectful i would try to get my colleague to go with me if i could n't , i 'd go by myself there are likely to be other people there who do n't know many others it 's a great opportunity to network and to show the client they are important to me and my company i would be very concerned i would step back and really think about what my manager said and why they had drawn that conclusion once i had calmed down , i would meet with my manager again to discuss it further if it is true , i want to remedy it moving forward if it 's not , i want a chance to share my thoughts on the situation i would find this an enjoyable experience i have never been to norway nor do i know a lot about the country or its customs it would be fun to learn more and a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel there all expenses paid i would look forward to this
i would ask my colleague if their plans are flexible if not , then i would try to arrange my own plans to help both of us out i would try to compromise i would finish the project early however , i would ask my boss if there will be any extra things i need to do before the due date that way , i am prepared i would go anyway i would just prepare myself with mental notes to make sure i have something to strike up conversations with it is too big of an opportunity to pass up just because i will not have a friend there i would tell my boss that i will definitely try to improve later on , though , i would ask my boss to talk privately and explain my views i would try to make both of us happy i would find this experience absolutely enjoyable i love nordic culture and scandinavians i would embrace the opportunity to the fullest extent
i would change my plans , as long as i do n't have anything non refundable it 's easier to be the person to cooperate than to refuse and be difficult i 'd rather my boss feel like they can rely on me for being easy going as opposed to a challenge i would get as much of the project done now this would be in anticipation of my boss giving me last minute tasks this would hopefully allow me to meet the deadline easily i would go anywhere to be there for our client i want them to know that we care about our relationship with them i would most likely invite another colleague to go with me i would ask my manager if there 's a way for me to correct the situation i might also talk to some colleagues that i trust , and get advice about what they would do if i lose my bonus , that would be unfortunate , but this would be a learning experience i would love to work on this project i love learning about other cultures and countries this would be a very enjoyable project and i think that i would excel at it
not change my plans make my supervisor figure it out not fair to make one of us change when we work very hardi would do the project first too make sure i get it completed early so i dont have to worry about it last minute taking over my life and stressing me outask them to please go it would mean alot to you and the company and it could help us learn more about are largest clienti would feel very upset i would go back to my manager and try to better understand the negative feedback and try to do my best and work hard at my job no matter what anyone saysi would find it interesting and enjoyable to learn about another country it would be really fun to do this
i would definitely be suspect as to why they didn t want to share their plans i would share the plans and if they were not important would switch the days i would expect my coworker to do me a favor in the future i would try and get the project done as soon as possible i would be able to have time to make any adjustments that might need to be made i would also have ample time to deal with any lass minute task from my boss i would still attend the networking meeting every opportunity is an opportunity for growth and success although , it would be a bit nerve racking to be alone , i might be able to accomplish more i would try and look at everything from a different prespective if i still felt correct , i would schedule a meeting with my manager i would make sure to have great points and non combative arguments ready for the meeting in hopes of remedying the situation i would find this enjoyable to learn about another culture would be fun and different if i were to do this , i would insist on traveling there to put all i ve learned to use
if i was told this far enough in advance , then i would change my vacation , but if i had already made vacation plans that could not be changed , then i would not change my vacation i would explain to my supervisor that hotels and shows had already been booked and paid for and i could not change the dates i would go ahead and start working on the project i would try to get some work done on it everyday by devoting at least an hour to it i would also try to finish it up as soon as possible , that way if my workload got tighter , i would still have to project completed on time i would go to the meeting whether my colleague went or not be because i would not want to miss the opportunity to network with an important client i would use the meeting as a way to discuss new business ideas and to make new contacts i would also use it as a way to expand on my client list i would ask my manager if there was any way that i could fix the problem or improve the situation i would also ask to see any thing that shows the impacts of my actions i would also discuss why i thought that the feedback was not true i would find this experience enjoyable because i would like learning about another culture i would also look at the experience as a way to gain experience working on projects from other countries i think that my work performance would benefit from the experience
it would depend on if i had made reservations and flight arrangements for a vacation that i could n't cancel if i was just spending the time at home , i would change my week to accomodate i would make a list of all the things that i would need to do and prioritize them i would tell my boss that i will complete each task to the best of my ability with the time that i have alotted to do themi would still go to boost my network i think it is always important to go to events such as these because making connections is imperative to a growing career i would put myself out there i would sit down with my manager and explain why i feel their feedback is n't justified if necessary , i would set up a meeting with a manager higher up in the company to discuss the review and how i could get things corrected i would find this experience enjoyable it is an interesting project that i would n't always get the opportunity to do it would also be an important project that would separate me from others when it comes time for promotions or other career opportunities
i would see if i could change my plans then i would immediately notify my supervisor of the new dates for my vacation i would also notify my colleague of my new plans i would let my colleague know that next time this happens , i will take my vacation as originally planned i would speak to my boss and give him her an update of my progress i would ask if there was anything new that needs to be added to complete the project i 'd ask him her if it 's okay to check back in a week to update my progress i 'd specifically ask if there may be any last minute tasks added to the project i would go by myself i would never pressure a colleague to do something it would be a good experience to meet new people and make new contacts i would feel very perturbed that being said , i would ask to have a meeting with my supervisor and respectfully refute things that i do n't believe to be true i would also specifically ask my supervisor to notify me if he sees something that i can improve on so that i can more successfully fulfill my role at the company i 'd find it enjoyable i like learning new things about different countries and cultures it would be great to work on a new project with new people it would also be a great way to make international contacts
i would demand that who ever has more senority get the desired week off it does not matter who wins in the end , as long as it is fair and nothing is more fair than getting something extra over someone else because you have devoted more time to the company i would put in extra hours to get the project done i am thankful for my job and want to make my boss happy at every corner that is how you move up in life i would go anyways im not a little sissy girl who has to have their hand held meeting new people is the way to get ahead in life most of the time people in high power positions got there based on who they know i would be humble and keep mu mouth shut i would then do my best to make sure that this never happened again fighting with your boss is never wise i would very much like this experience it really does not get any better than to travel for work and get paid for doing it its truly a win win situation
if this was a vacation where i did not have a financial investment already made that forced me to go \( plane ticket , reservations at hotel or lodging \) and or a plan to meet with friends or family that was scheduled in advance , i would be willing to change my plans if i was willing to volunteer to change my plans , i would then ask for a coin flip i would make sure to complete everything i have to do as soon as i can to make sure i have the bandwidth to take on any last minute tasks i would be proactive and ask my boss in advance if they can think of anything that needs to be done in the project so that i can get them done before last minute this would allow me the time to get things done while at the same time look proactive and on top of things to my superior i would try to convince my colleague to go with me and try to make it enticing for them to come if they still refuse to come , then i would still go ahead on my own and try to meet new people i do not worry too much about not knowing other people there since it is a networking event and as such , it is assumed that people are there to make new contacts i would ask my manager for more detail as to why i got the feedback and ask what i could do better so that i can improve this makes me look like i want to perform better i would also ask if i could also get feedback from other people that see my work to make sure there is a consensus among others this would expose whether i really have something to work on and improve or whether this feedback is isolated i would likely find it enjoyable as i enjoy learning about different countries and cultures and it is good knowledge to have in case i ever meet other norwegians or want to visit some day learning about new things that may or may not be interesting are always going to come up in life so finding ways to make it interesting is always a good idea
i would suggest that the matter should be settled based on who first requested the time off in the event that the requests were both made at the same time , the individual with the most seniority should be allowed to take the time off if these solutions cannot work the supervisor should make the decision i would begin the project right away it would be a good idea to complete it as soon as possible that way it will not be an issue if the boss gives a last minute task it depends whether i had other plans if not , i would attend and make some new contacts if i already had plans i would decline the invitation i would ask for a meeting in which i would have an opportunity to answer the feedback i might ask for an independent observer to be there if i have had any trouble with this sort of thing from my manager this would also be an opportunity for my manager to attempt to explain the feedback it might be enjoyable , new experiences frequently are it would likely be more enjoyable if it did involve travel but then again , we are talking about norway
i would do my best to change my vacation time if it was an issue where i absolutely could n't reschedule then i would approach my co worker and speak to them about the issue explaining that i would change if i could i would also assess why they need that particular time off i would do my best to come to a peaceful resolution where we are both satisfied i would immediately accomplish everything i could get done for the project if it 's practically completed then i would have as much done as possible if my boss gives me any last minute tasks i would be able to solely focus my time and attention on anything that was added last minute the key here is to use proper time management even if my work load was light i would n't put off getting something done exactly the opposite in fact , i would complete the project to the best of my abilities and wait for the last minute additions , knowing that i have time to complete them i would more than likely go despite what my colleague chooses to do this is a networking meeting , it 's irrelevant to me whether or not i know anyone else there that 's part of networking , meeting new people i would attend the event and meet the important clients as well as any other individuals i could i 'd try to make new acquaintances to help my position in the company i would take the time to evaluate what my manager or boss said sometimes , we can all have an internal bias toward ourselves i 'd want to know if what he or she said was true if it was true then i would adjust my behavior accordingly if it was n't true then i would document myself and my actions more carefully in the future to address this with superiors if something similar should occur again i would definitely find this enjoyable i'm the type of person who actively tries to learn new things i read quite a lot so i would find it rewarding to learn things about norway 's culture and fun facts about the country you never know when this could benefit you in the future so i do n't think it would be boring or detrimental in any way also , if i were to volunteer for the project then my boss would be able to see my hard work and would hopefully find me to be an asset
i would change my plans as long as i did not buy plane tickets already i am always willing to help someone else out my vacations are flexible i can work around someone else i would start the project as soon as i can i like to get things done early waiting to do something creates stress for me i would like to have it done so i can focus on any new projects i would find a way to talk my coworker into going to the meeting i think it is very important to network and spread my wings so to speak i would definitely get them to go it s important i would talk to his boss about this i would feel really upset by this i take my job seriously and give it my best i would need to get this fixed i would not find this intriguing i am not into the norway culture i also would be afraid at some point i would have to go to norway and i don t want to do that i would avoid this
it would depend on several factors , but off the get go i would be upset i would more than likely change my plans if push came to shove i do n't do well with personnel conflict issues also my plans are normally fluid for vacation i would use this time to knock it out , in case my boss adds things at the last moment this would make me feel more confident as the due date comes up i would be less stressed and better able to deal with unexpected changes or tasks that come up i would make a better product too , with more time to finalize and improve upon it i would go to the meeting i care about my career and this would help i would be nervous and anxious with not knowing people there however , a good situation should never be passed up i would bring this up to my manager the next day after i was able to think about it for a night if i still did n't agree and did n't gain resolution with them , would ask to take it to their boss i would feel angry and upset that i was viewed this way in my performance i would use this as a learning experience if i did n't get anywhere with it , and improve upon myself at work i would find this experience quite enjoyable , i love learning new things i would find fun and pleasure in taking on this extra work , especially if travel were to come into play i always like to learn new things and expand on my knowledge of cultures in this world it helps that i'm sure it would help me out in my career too , and progressing it
i would speak to the employee and explain that i have been there longer , also that i have children and i need to plan my vacations around there schedule and i would see if they would reconsider i would handle it the best i could , and strive to complete it on time i may speak to my boss and explain to my boss that he might need to tone it down a bit i would explain the situation and ask them if they could please go for the sake of the team this is our biggest client and we really need to put in the effort and go i could confront my manager and explain that i dont agree with them and that his feedback could cost me my bonus and that i always go above and beyond and that i would like him to reconsider i would find it somewhat enjoyable , it would be more fun to be able to travel and all but i do enjoy stuff like this , i enjoy broadening my horizons and this would be a fun task to work on
if they requested the time off before me , i would accept it and move my vacation however , if they asked for the time off after i did , i would stand my ground and defend my reasoning i would talk it over with my boss to make sure he understands my side of the situation i would get started on the project as soon as it was given to me \( or as soon as my other projects responsibilities allow \) especially because my workload is light i would also review the project with my boss when i am completed even if before the deadline to make sure they do n't have any changes for me this would allow me extra time if needed to add last minute additions i would suggest they go with me to the meeting if they really do n't want to go , maybe i would offer to go out for a drink with them after as incentive if they are still unwilling to go , i think i would still go to the networking meeting i would ask them for examples of the negative feedback i would have a conversation with them about the topics they bring up , and try to defend my case i would make sure to do this in a respectable way so i do n't make the situation worse hopefully we would be able to work something out and i would n't face negative consequences i would find this experience boring i do n't find much pleasure in research projects like this i would rather let someone else who is more excited about the project do it rather than me
i would change my plans i believe this would be most helpful in accommodating my vacation , my coworkers vacation and our workload if it for some reason could not be changed at all , i would look to see if there was someone else who could help with the workload i would set daily goals in order to get this project completed ahead of time i would do this just incase i get a late task assigned to me it will also help me to not feel as stressed i would still go at least for a little while in order to put the best face forward for my company i also think this might help secure us more work in the future i would be nervous to go alone but overall it would be a good decision for my own personal growth as well as the companies i would talk to the hr department to get their opinion on the scenario i might also arrange a sit down with my manager and a third party if i felt something was incorrect i would not want it to damage my status in the company at all i would definitely find this to be enjoyable i would love to learn things about the country and culture of norway i would even offer to travel if need be
i would feel very disappointed and let my supervisor know i would ask him to be fair and let the person who requested time off first to be allowed to go if i would have to give up my vacation week , i would ask for extra pay for that week i would feel like the boss maybe does not like me , but i would not challenge the decision to give me extra work i would work hard to complete the tasks in the future , i would try to not take situations like this personally and try to get along with my supervisor i would try to convince him of going i would urge him to take action and not skip an opportunity it would be an ideal opportunity to share ideas with people about the business we are in and get more ideas from them i would carefully look at the negative feedback and think positive steps i could take to improve my performance also , i would ask to speak with my manager about it and thank them for the feedback i would discuss a few proposals with him or her i would ask clarification about the issue , too i would enjoy this experience because i would get to learn about the culture of another country i most likely would have to learn about the history of norway and it 's people i am already interested in history and different people , so it would be easy for me to do
i would not change my vacation plans the reason being is that i asked for the vacation time off first so the coworker will have no choice but to change their plans i would evaluate each last minute task that my boss gives me from the evaluation i will decide how much time each tasks take if i know i can finish everything on time then i will complete the tasks if not i will tell my boss that some tasks wont be able to make the due date this way everybody can be informed on the status of the projecti would first try to convince my colleague to go to the meeting being that is our largest client , i can stress the importance of having the most team members possible if he ultimately decides not to go , i will still go to the meeting i will do my best to introduce myself to people at the meeting if i show up it will show our client that we care about them i would set up a meeting with my manager to discuss the feedback i will express my concerns and ask for specific cases that led to the negative feedback i will also explain how i feel the feedback isnt true hearing negative feedback will make me feel bad and surprised , so it 's important to find the root causei would probably find the experience boring if i did not get to travel to norway if i did get to travel to norway , then i would be enthusiastic about learning about the country and culture the travel aspect will definitely feel like a bonus
i would take in to considerationwho has the most senority i know that i was next to last that was hired therefore my colleague would be with in their right to take vacation time before me i would priotize my assignments i would complete the most urgent assignments first then i would leave the unimportant jobs to the side my main focus is to complete my project before two weeks are up i would proceed to the networking meeting it would be benefical for the entire company i would mingle amongst the clients and make new accuaintances i would find out how i could increase my feedback to positive for the time around i would ask how could i improve my work performance i would from that point forward work extremely hard to get positive remarks from manager i would find the experience very enjoyable learning anything new is a plus for resume enhancements i would loveto learn about the culture of norway , it is exciting
i would speak to my supervisor and see who requested first whoever was first should get the time if this does not solve the issue i will not hesitate to go above my supervisor to the manager i would do my assigned project as normal taking my time to ensure it is correct if i am given a last minute task i will still continue my original project if i am not finished if i finish early i will start the next task but will let my boss know i may not finish i would still attend the networking event if i feel too uncomfortable while there i will just leave early i would rather show up than not i would speak with my manager about the feedback i would listen to their side but also give mine i will not leave until matters are settled and comfortable on both ends i would find this experience enjoyable learning about other countries is very excited and opens your minds to new things this will also give me an oppotunity to learn about norway just in case i do have a chance to visit one day
i would talk with my supervisor and ask if they approve of this if i had nothing specific planned , i would be willing to change my vacation date i would remind my supervisor that i would hope this would not happen again i would make sure that i had the project completed in advance just in case my boss would give me something else to do that way i could just go and put the final touches on the original project and show my boss i am well organized and plan ahead i would suggest that it would be very beneficial if my colleague would make the attempt to go and introduce me to contacts that way the next time i would feel more confident and would feel comfortable attending alone i would ask that my manager and i could have a time to sit down and talk about this feedback i would approach it as i want to show i am concerned and want to improve on anything i need to , but need it explained to me as to why i received this negative feedback i would find this experience enjoyable and l would love to learn new things i would except this as a challenge i would think it would show my company that i am willing to take on new tasks and would show i have initiative
i would consider if my plans were changeable for example , i 'd check to see if i could change my hotel or flight dates and i 'd have to check with the kids schools to see when they can take off of school then i 'd be able to come back with an answer of whether i can or ca n't be more accommodating i would be glad for the knowledge of how my boss works and would plan accordingly i would complete the majority of the task ahead of time so i 'd have time to accommodate the last minute tasks later on i would definitely feel uncomfortable going alone to the meeting i would try to convince or even bribe my colleague to go with me , if that does n't work i would introduce myself to the person from my company that is going so we can get to know each other i would feel extremely upset at first and would need a minute or two to calm down after that i could think rationally and realize that my manager does n't have to have the last word i could bring up my rebuttal to my manager and if that does n't work then i could calmly defend myself to my manager 's superior i would love this experience , i love learning about different countries or cultures and how wonderful it would be to do it while actually getting paid i love to look up different cultures on the internet or read books about it
i would make my plans for a different time i would try and make sure that i could do what i wanted to a different time i need to make sure that there is a good teamwork vibe at work i would make sure that since i had light work i would work ahead that way if there was any work that was given at the last minute then it would be taken care of i would make sure that i meet my goal i would still go to the meeting make sure that i held my end of the deal then i would also make sure to reschedule if they did n't show i would make sure that i told what i saw happened i would make sure that people would understand what really happened then i would ask what i could do in the future to change the stuff i would look up on google all about norway i would make sure that i studied the facts about norway that way i could rock the meeting
it would depend on how set my plans were for example , if i was taking vacation because my daycare was closed that week , i 'd have little room to budge if i could n't take it off , but could n't be at work \( like if my daycare was closed \) , i 'd ask if i could work from home or flex my schedule instead also , maybe my colleague and i could split the week and both take half i would get it done as soon as i was able in case other last minute projects crop up i 'd also like to get a jump on it , because i might be overlooking issues that could come up on the project for example , maybe i 'd have to wait for information from someone and it would take longer than expected i 'd also lean towards not going i am not big on networking to begin with , but especially after a long day , i would not be inclined to go also , i really value my time with my family , so i 'd just want to go home and see my kids before they go to bed things like this are so different when you have kids i would be extremely frustrated if i could , i would provide evidence to support my point of view to my manager if it appeared the issue laid with my manager , i 'd consider going above him her , depending on how the layers above him are i would find this to be an exciting project i 'd love the chance to learn about a new country and work with new people if it required travel , i would not volunteer at this point though because i have small children at home that i ca n't be away from
i would talk to them about why i need the vacation and not budge it 's extremely unsettling to plan something and have to move chances are those days were planned way in advancei would do the project as quickly and efficiently as possible i would finish it up earlier and prepare for the worst making it look as best as possible is what i would want i would continue to go to the meeting i ca n't lose my job or sacrifice my money for someone else it would be dumb of me not to go i would ask to schedule a meeting with my boss i would plead my case and get him to see that i'm right i feel nervous but ultimately would have to do it i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about new countries and learning in general it would be fun to learn about a country that is probably very different from mine i would take that opportunity in a heartbeat
i would agree to take a different week off if the coworker was willing to make a gesture to me i would suggest exchanging a certain number of off days or to cover tasks at work for a short time if the coworker was unwilling to do so i 'd argue to the supervisor or hr that the person with seniority should get preferred vacation time i do n't see why i should automatically agree to change my plans based on the information given i would work to get the project finished as soon as possible in case more work is required at the last minute if the work load is light it would be better to work harder and get it finished than have more work dumped on top of the uncompleted project if the project is completed and no other work is presented it would be an opportunity to either get a head start on a new project or to take time off i 'd tell them they can choose to go or not as they like i would also tell them that any leads or deals i make would be mine to manage as i see fit if they do n't want an opportunity to network with a large client that 's fine but they should n't get any benefits from any effort i put forth when they were unwilling to do the same i would feel annoyed but if the feedback was incorrect there is not a lot that can be done about it if there were a way to prove it was incorrect information that led to the feedback i would want to do so it is important however to not appear to be fixated on criticism and sometimes it 's best to let it go you have to be careful in situations like this as disputing criticism can make it seem you are stubborn and reinforce negative opinions i would jump at the chance it would not only be enjoyable to work with a new client from the start but also an excellent opportunity i'm always interesting in learning more about different cultures being exposed to an unfamiliar culture can help to allow one to see things in a different light as well as to see things more creatively
i would change my plans unless it was already paid for if i paid and booked a trip already i would not cancel my plans some trips are non refundable so it would not be able to be changed i would start the project right away just incase something else comes up i would rather be done early instead of stressing myself out trying to finish last minute incase even if something does n't come up at least i would have extra free time i would go to the meeting i would give me a advantage with the client i would not want a major client thinking poorly of me i may be tired but the advantage is worth it i would try to talk with my manager about how i disagree with the feedback the manager may be able to explain it better if i still disagree i would try to explain why she is wrong i would think this experiance would be enjoyable i love learning about different cultures i would love to learn about different countries and how they differ from us
i would probably change my vacation plans if they were n't urgent i am all about compromise and would rather reschedule than lose out on vacation i also think its a waste of time to deal much with stubborn or difficult people i would schedule my time carefully and work on the project as soon as possible i would plan so that i could finish early and have time for any extra tasks that might be added i would also communicate with my boss frequently about the workload and whether more tasks would be added i would go to the event regardless the reason is that it would likely be beneficial to me it would n't make sense for me to miss out on something that could help me simply because of a coworkers choicei would feel upset about the situation i would speak to my boss about my disagreement and try to find understanding if he still gave the negative review i would speak with higher ups i would find this experience enjoyable i would be excited to visit a new country and learn the culture also , traveling for work would be cheaper than personal travel
i would change my vacation plans i do understand the dilemma for my company , and would find no problem re scheduling my vacation time i would wish my college a very happy vacation , and would be thankful that my vacation would be coming up when they got back i would explain the situation to my boss i 'd ask my boss if he she could either give me those last minute tasks earlier , or save them until i had my current project done i would tell my boss that i'm confident in my ability to handle the project , but that those last minute additional tasks on top of doing my project make things very stressful i would gladly go to the networking meeting alone when i got there i would talk to as many people as i could i would thoroughly enjoy talking with our largest client and everyone else at this meeting i feel honored , and thankful to be going to this meeting ! i would stand up for myself in a diplomatic way i would state positive , concrete facts about my work , and set the record straight i do n't believe what my manager said about me was true , and i would wonder why he would say untruths about me , but at the same time , i would forgive him , and try my best to get along i would find this experience enjoyable it is very interesting to learn things about another country and culture it would be all right not to travel , but it would be even more exciting to actually be in the country i do n't see how this project could possibly be boring
i would look and see what i have planned at that time if not a big deal , i would go ahead and change my plans i would however check and see if we have duplicate times in the future , if so , i would ask i get the next time i would start working on it right away i would expect to have new things added at the last minute so i would be prepared i would be sure my boss knew that i was doing thisi would go because its the right thing to do my client is inviting me and i want to create a favorable impression i do n't care if my coworker does n't go , thats their problemi would be very upset and annoyed i would ask him why and how he thinks i should proceeed in the future i would try , as best i could , to listen to him and be open i would think it was great i love to learn about new places and people i would relish the change and chance
i would try to negotiate with the coworker if they do n't even try to act like they would try to accommodate the situation i would go ahead and change my plans and hope that the co worker would need me for something important i woul d not help them with anything on purpose i am pretty sure they would need me and ask me for favors and i would gladly tell them no i would go ahead and try my best to finish what i have so far make sure i think of things that he may want to include later and go ahead and do it just incase it is something he may ask for later i would also ask around to see if its something that others are thinking they may be included in the project i would try to finish the actual project as soon as possible and not at the last step i would beg the collegue to go i would talk about how much fun we can have together and tell them how much fun we can have by ourselves and talk about the others there they we do n't like i would explain how much food i know they would have and how good it will be i would beg her more and offer to pick her up as well i would politely explain how the feedback i was given was n't really accurate i would make sure to have proof of how i know it is n't the truth i would also ask around of other peoples opinion of what i should say and do and see if anybody i work with has ever had their bonus taken away because they voiced their opinion i just might even call hr to complain and explain on how i was feeling about the lies being told i would definitely find the trip enjoyable experience an experience that i probably would never do this on my own i would be so excited to go and heavily ready to learn i would search and read anything i can about the country and see about the culture make sure i read up on what not to do while i am there and where to not go make sure i read up on the dangerous parts of the country i find it will be exciting giving the opportunity to travel even if it was for business and learning anything new would be fun
i would first consider what extenuating circumstances might be leading my colleague to be so inflexible i would then consider whether i am able to be flexible if i am able to be flexible , then i would change my plans , but i might hold a bit of a grudge against the colleague if i am not able to be flexible , i would ask to speak to my colleague about it to see if we could negotiate something if we could not negotiate , i would ask my supervisor to consider being flexible perhaps we could each agree to monitor email or participate in calls remotely i would get as much as possible done as soon as i can i anticipate that i could have last minute demands on my time , so procrastination on this project could really hurt me i might also update my boss on the status of my project and map out my work plan for the next two weeks , and ask my boss outright if s he anticipates having additional needs that we can plan for now , so nothing gets derailed i would try to talk my colleague into going , and try to make a deal that we would both go , just for an hour if my effort to persuade my colleague was unsuccessful , i would probably not go to the networking meeting either i am quite introverted and hate these things under any circumstances while i know i should go , my social anxiety would probably override any sense of obligation i would probably apologize and lie about the reason for my absence i would reflect on the feedback for a day or two and consider whether there is an element of truth to it i would likely request to sit down with my manager , once i was confident that i would not be too emotional i would acknowledge their opinion but also offer my perspective respectfully i would find the experience enjoyable i think it 's fun to learn about other cultures , and norway seems pretty tame normal , so i think i would probably enjoy dealing with the client i would probably try to persuade the client and my company that i would need to travel to norway at some point
i would ask the supervisor , first of all , if he could allow me to take my vacation anyhow if he said it was n't possible i would change my plans and work it out for another time i would talk to my boss ahead of time and tell him that i am working hard on this workload and that if i am given a last minute task it could jeopardize the work that i am doing if he was to come up to me anyhow with an extra task i would remind him of our talk earlier if he refused to budge and said i had to complete this new task i would ask the boss for help on the new task and tell him i was not going to let it hinder my workload and hope he would understand , i would tell my colleague that i understand his not wanting to go but ask him if he would please go for just a few minutes and introduce me to people if he said no i would tell him there were no hard feelings and go by myself once there i would start introducing myself and hope for a good outcome i would feel upset and i would go to the manager and talk to him about it if he said he was n't going to budge on his feedback i would go above his head and talk to someone else and see if they could look into what was going on and why my manager was giving me negative feedback that was not deserved i would find it very enjoyable i love learning about new cultures and countries as long as language was n't a barrier i would be very receptive
i would find out who asked for the vacation time first if they asked first then i would be willing to move my week to another if i asked first i would explain to the supervisor that i was the first to ask for that week and insist that i get it not my colleague i would try to get this project done as quickly as possible this would help a great deal in case my boss once again pulls the nonsense of giving me last minute tasks i 'd take the initiative to make sure being given last minute tasks does n't negatively impact me i would go because it sounds like a good opportunity to advance my network of contacts and be seen i wo n't care that i do n't know anybody there because that is irrelevant i 'd be able to meet the people at one of our largest clients and it would help to make a good name for myself in the industry i would ask the manager to set aside time to go over the negative feedback and why it was given i would keep and open mind about whether they were right or not if i was treated unfairly , though , i would brush up my resume and start looking for another job i would find it very interesting because i like learning about different cultures i would definitely like not having to travel there except maybe rarely so that would help i would likely learn new skills and insights by taking on this project
i would go over the calendar with my colleague and manager and schedule out an alternate time i would also ask to get first pick on the next vacation period showing a bit of goodwill early will payoff later by being gracious about it , i'm showing my willingness to be a team player to both my coworkers and management i would block out specific times of day to totally focus on the project that way i can still complete my usual tasks , but still focus on the larger project i would start early and keep my supervisor up to date on my progress , to lessen the chance of large , last minute changes i would try to convince my colleague to go anyway i would offer to drive and to buy lunch the next day it would also motivate me to use the time at the event wisely , and to make as many contacts as possible this would also show that i am committed to our large client , and down the line i may be the main point of contact with that client , instead of my colleague i would not feel good about the situation at all however , it would be very important that i make a meeting with my manager and discuss the review in depth i would provide as much evidence as possible to give a clear picture of my actual performance even if this does not get the review changed , i would use the opportunity to show that i am committed to the company and am always working on ways to improve on my performance i would probably volunteer first , it would be interesting to learn new things about the country also , it would increase my value to the company , and if future travel or project management with this client was available , i would likely to be tapped as a resource in that area doing so would increase my value and make me a vital part of our relationship with that client
i would change my vacation plans i would be positive i would hope for the best i would try to finish the project i would want it done then i would n't have to worry about other tasks i would beg my colleague to go i would try to get that person to go if not i would go and make the best of it i would explain my side of the situation i would not want to lose a bonus i would tell my manager and hope for the best i would find it boring i would rather do something else learning is no fun without travel
i would sit down with my colleague and review such things as seniority , pertinence of the vacation and who requested the vacation first if we could not come to an agreement after discussing the vacation time that was requested i may opt to change my vacation to a later date as to keep the solidarity and harmony of my workplace i may ask that my boss steer clear of giving last minute tasks that may interfere with the completion of the project the option of delegating last minute projects to other co workers would explained to my boss so that the productivity of the company would not suffer also , i may try to finish the project ahead of time if my boss is adamant about giving me last minute projects explaining the importance of this meeting to my colleague would take place if my co worker does n't want to attend the meeting after the discussion i would possibly look for someone to attend with me if i am not successful in finding someone to accompany me to this very important meeting i would go alone so that my business relationship with the client is not jeopardized i would explain that although i disagree with the criticism i would take it in consideration i would evaluate the feedback to see if there is any necessary changes that i needed to make my employment at the company is very important because this is how i provide for my family , so therefore i would view the feedback as a positive and not view it as negative yes , i would definitely find this opportunity enlightening i enjoy learning about different cultures that are different from my own as an employee of a company that has culturally diverse clients , i feel that it would be important for me to expand my worldview as this would not only help me in my career but also in my personal life
i would ask if there was a way we could discuss it i would talk to a supervisor and see if they could intervene if nothing could be done , i would see if i could switch up my vacation plans i would take into account how much needs to be done and how long i have to complete it i would break down the tasks daily i would make sure i got it done in advance to plan for any additional tasks i may get i would try to convince them it is a great opportunity for us i would try to figure out why they do not want to go i would encourage them by telling them i would help them out i would feel really angered and stressed out i would go to my manager and ask him why i was graded the way i was , and see if we could talk about it if i did not get the answers i was looking for , i would talk to another supervisor i would love to be a part of it i would stress to my supervisor that i would definitely like the opportunity i love challenges and learning new things about different cultures
i would change my vacation plans because i would not want to cause a dispute over vacation i am usually pretty flexible , and this would be an easy way to maybe gain some priority in vacation time if it comes up again i just think there are more important things to argue about i would work very hard to go ahead and complete the project this way , if the boss gives me something at the last minute , i could complete it too i would try to stay focused and organized i would still go because it sounds like an important networking opportunity i would just be outgoing and talk to as many possible clients as i could i would make sure i looked great though because that gives me more confidence i would definitely fight to change the feedback because i know the work i do is excellent i would talk to the manager first , and then i would go to the next level if necessary i would make sure to gather documentation of my actual work successes progress to back up my claim i would think this experience would be awesome ! i love to learn about different cultures , and norway seems like a cool place i would definitely volunteer
i would tell him that he can have that week this year if he would agree on what i had to say next i would then tell him that if he agreed , i would get to choose my vacation week before him next year i would do this because i am easy to get along with i would ask my boss if i could work overtime hours in order to get my project going i would tell him that in case something comes up or if he would have some other tasks that needs to be done , that i would be able to get my project done on time i would also tell him that i could work on the week end to get my project completed on time i would do this because i think very highly of my boss i would attend the networking meeting even though my colleague may not be attending the meeting , i would enjoy seeing our clients and others who will be in attendance i feel by attending the meeting , it will help in my relationship with my boss i would do this because it is actually part of my job i would be very upset , but he is the manager i would tell him that i will work harder and do my very best to correct this issue i would tell him that i enjoy working for him and for the company and i do not want to hurt the company in any way i would apology for anything i did that was not the best work i would be very happy to volunteer for this project i enjoy learning new things and norway is one of my favorite countries i enjoy learning about other countries and their culture this would be very enjoyable for me
i would ask my colleague if they had definitive plans that could not be changed if they had airfare or a vacation planned i would understand if they did not and i did i would try and convince them to let me have the week i would work on the project as much as possible to make sure it is completed with time left over for other projects should they occur if my boss assigned me something else i would ask for clarity on the priorities of assigned projects i would beg and plead for my colleague to go i hate going to things like that without knowing anyone if they decide not to go , i may come up with an excuse why i ca n't go too i would feel horrible about the situation and feel like i was treated unfairly i would schedule a meeting with my boss to go over their feedback and state my reasons why i do n't believe it to be true i would find it enjoyable i am always up to learning new things and learn about new cultures i feel taking on the responsibility will also look good for me in the future
i have to deal this situation all the time since i work for a small company i would always come up with a solution that works for both of us if i did not have any vacations plans , i would gladly change my plans as to the hope that the other person would do the same to me i would tackle the project that is due in two weeks as soon as possible , especially if my workload was light this way i could get it done and still have time to do the additional tasks that might be handed to me i would go the meeting anyways , even if i did not know anyone there it would be a great way for me to meet people in my career field and learn something while i was at it i would not have not knowing anyone there stop me i would ask my manager what i could do to improve and what my objectives would be at least this way i would know how to improve the negative feedback in the future i would find this very enjoyable i like to learn about different cultures , and like to share my own i would see this as a learning experience and a chance to make a new friend
depending on whether or not i had reservations , i would probably change mine if i did have plans which i had already paid for , i would ask my employer to grant the vacation according to who asked first and seniority i would make sure i had the vacation approved before making plans though i would try to get as much done on the project as early as possible if any last minute tasks came up , i would do them first to leave more time for the project i would devote my extra time to the project due in two weeks i would try to convince my colleague to go i would probably go myself to make an appearance i would not try to make my colleague look or feel bad for not going but think someone should make an appearance first of all i would be upset i would ask my manager what i did to get the bad feedback i would then try to do better if possible , i would find it enjoyable learning new things always makes my job more interesting it would be fun to learn about a different country and culture
i would ask , once again , if the coworker would be willing to change their plans if it was n't possible , and they coworker seemed like it was important to them , i would talk about changing my date for vacation i would make sure to let my coworker know that i was changing my plans , and that they should know that i was the one who forfeited my original plans , to show flexibility at work i would take on the project at a normal pace i would expect to finish as planned , and work around anything that came up i would ask for help , if needed , if my boss threw something else at me last minute i would ask my coworker to make a little time and just make a short appearance i would tell them that i owe them , and next awful business meeting i will go with them to it i would be sure to let them know that i appreciate them coming along , and it would make me way more comfortable i would feel let down with myself for some reason , they must see something that i do n't i would look deep into what i do day to to day , and see what i can do to fix my problems i would ask them , the manager , what they suggest to show that i'm serious about being better in their eyes i would find this experience to be fun i would love to learn about another country and their cultures i think it would be fascinating to take on a project like this it 's a change of pace from the normal day to day grind , and would let me learn along the way
i would first go to my supervisor to discuss if it is truly the case that only one of us could go if that did not work i would go to the colleague and try to convince them again i could compensate the colleague to not go that week i would start the project early and get it done early i would worry that a new task would compromise my ability to finish the project doing it early would ease my anxiety i would try and convince my colleague to go i would feel awkward going without knowing anyone i would possibly convince my colleague to go by offering some reward for going i would feel like my manager was treating me unfairly i would first go to my manager to discuss the feedback if this did not got well i would escalate to someone above the manager to discuss my work performance i would find this experience enjoyable i also think it would be good knowledge to know in general it would give me an advantage for new jobs
if i had more seniority and the vacation was already planned i would try and talk my co worker into changing if that person still insists on that same week i would find a mediator to help i would continue the project as usual except maybe get as much done ahead of time as possible i would also ask for help if needed if my boss gave me more than i could handle i would reason with him or her and explain about the other project i do n't see a problem here i would attend the meeting with the client no matter what if my coworker did n't attend that would be okay with me i would discuss our difference of option and hope to change my manager 's mind if not successful changing her mind i would write out the reasons why i do n't agree and supply evidence of my achievements this would be awesome ! i would love an assignment like that great way to learn another culture
i would tell my supervisor i ca n't change my plan because i already booked hotel and plane ticket it is too expensive to make changes now i will do extra work for colleagues that help cover me when i am awayi would finish the project ahead of time since i am not busy i will anticipate last minute task from my boss , then i will have enough time to finish extra work i would persuade my colleague to go with me if my colleague does n't want to go , i will go by myself i just wo n't stay for long and i will try my best to make some new connections and hopefully get new clients i would feel very upset i may try to talk to my manager and figure out why the negative feedback at the same time try to do my job better so leave no chance for a negative feedback i would find the opportunity challenging even though it does n't involve travelling , it is still an opportunity to learn new things , and learning new things is what makes a job interesting so i do n't think it is going to be boring
i would still request the same vacation days and i would let my supervisor no that i need those days to coordinate with my wife 's vacation days and my kids if i cannot get those days then it really does n't matter because any other days means i am vacationing by myselfi would finish my project as soon as possible since my workload is light right now i prefer to get things done as quickly as possible so that i can easily handle any other tasks that may come up i would still go to the meeting because i think its important to my career to have a relationship with such important client i think it would strengthen my job opportunities and help me grow within the companyi feel angry that i have received such negative feedback i will go home and contemplate why i received such feedback and think of any situations that could have contributed to me getting the negative feedback i will then approach my boss in a humble manner and how i can improve my performance and let them know that i am committed to my job and appreciate the feedback and will use it as an opportunity to growi enjoy reading and learning so i would definitely find this opportunity to be enjoyable it would be a challenging task that i would take on i think it would be great to have a client from another country and learning the culture would be fun
i would go to the supervisor and tell him that it should go on seniority whichever empolyee that hired out first should get the week the reason why i would do this is because its the only fair way and hopefully the supervisor would be commendable to it if my workload is light , i would try and get it done early first i would like to get it finished early because i dont know what the boss is going to add for me also finish early so that if i need to change anything on the project , i have time i would go anyway honestly , i would be nervous avout not knowing anyone but ultimately , i would decide to go and try to meet new people this could be beneficial at work , but also socially i would be extremely nervous and upset about this and would be desperate to correct the problem i would try to request a meeting with my manager to discuss the feedback i would try to find a way to respectfully voice why i disagreed with the assessment and try to convince the manager to reevaluate i would find this enjoyable i think that any learning opportunity is a good thing , even if it is a challenge also , i am very fascinated by different cultures and like any opportunity to gain worldly experience or knowledge
i would change my plans i'm usually easy to deal with and can find another suitable time to go it is currently only my wife and i with no specific plans taking another date would and making it easier for my supervisor could be a benefit for me in the future i would get right to work on the project and try to get it finished sooner rather than later procrastinating could be destructive if another tasks needs to be done and my project is behind i would go anyways rather i knew people or not meeting new people and getting along with them is part of the process of communication the whole ideal of networking is to meet and mingle with others for future business i would not be very happy about it and would like to talk about it with my supervisor i would like to discuss it so i understand what the thinking is and see if a mistake was made i would like to be involved it would give me an opportunity to learn more about norway and they 're culture and more about how they live anytime you learn something new it broadens your horizons and can be useful for future projects
i would reschedule my vacation being part of a team requires flexibility , there are times we need to make sacrifices and be their for our company i feel optimistic that at some point in the future my colleague would return the favor and help me when i needed it i would set daily goals to complete the project early it would be the responsible choice planning on completing the project early would potentially reduce stress later it is important to me to produce high quality work and this seems the best way for the project and unforeseen work to be completed well i would attend the meeting i'm not concerned about not knowing anyone , i'm a friendly person and would be able to navigate the event just fine on my own although i'm sure i would be tired , it is an important opportunity to get to know the client and for them to get to know me it seems too good to pass up i would feel horrible and misunderstood i would ask for more details on the feedback to make sure i fully understood the input if after further explanation , i still disagreed i would ask for my manager to reconsider given the possible consequences , it seems important to at least try to have the feedback redacted i would find it quite enjoyable i find other countries and cultures intriguing such experiences expand our worldview and make us global citizens i would be willing to put in extra effort on this task , not only for the benefit of the company , but also for my growth
i would offer to let the colleague take the vacation time off now in return , i would ask that my request for time off around the christmas holidays take priority over any other request that seems like a fair trade off i would do everything possible to complete the project early this would give me leeway if any last minute tasks do enter the picture plus , getting the project done earlier may have benefits for me as an employee i would attend the meeting this would give me an advantage in the future if the networking meeting goes well i would make sure my manager knows i am doing this i would think about the situation overnight in the morning , i would request a few minutes with the manager to discuss the feedback my goal would be to show him her that there are things he she did n't take into account that are favorable to me i would find this experience to be very enjoyable not only would i learn about norway , but i could develop networking contacts that are valuable this could hold me in good stead in the future
i would change my vacation to a different week i can likely make my vacation plans work for another time i am not picky about when i take vacation i would complete the majority of the project at the front end of the two weeks i have i would leave some time towards the end of the two weeks to finish the project and review the work i did earlier in the two week deadline if my boss does have last minute tasks for me i will spend extra hours in the office to finish both these new tasks and the project i would convince my colleague to attend with me i would tell him or her that we could provide a lot of value to the company if we attended it will also look better if we both go as it will show our company has a good turnout and that we care about this particular client i would be upset about this , but not angry i would follow up with colleagues and other superiors to see if their view of my performance aligns with this negative feedback if it does not , i would take evidence from these other sources \( e g colleagues and superiors \) and present it to my supervisor if the feedback was accurate i would follow up with my supervisor and see what he or she would suggest i do in order to improve i would find this experience enjoyable i think it would be fun to learn about another country , especially in the context of work having the learning take place in a work context would reinforce my learning i would likely be able to take that learning and apply it in my real life for instance , maybe i could take a personal trip to norway if i find what i learn to be interesting
i would discuss with my colleague about the vacation week i would see if there was any possibility for a compromise if maybe both of us could take off around the same time without overlapping i would get working on the project right away in case any issues would arise while working on the project or if any additional workload comes up i would talk with my colleague to see why they are leaning towards not going i would find out if there was any way they would change their mind i would plan on going even if by myself i would see the negative feedback as a chance to grow i would also discuss with the manager what i could do about the feedback i would also discuss with others , such as , hr about my options regarding the feedback i would find this experience enjoyable it would be a learn more about another country and culture it would be a chance to grow personally and professionally
i would try to change my dates if i could not change my dates , i would go to my coworker again and ask if they could change if the coworker will not change the dates , i would go to my supervisor and ask again i would do ask much work on the current project as possible i would have nothing to do near the end of the project so i will be ready for any extra tasks he gives me i like to get things done as soon as possible just in case anything additional is put on my plate i would go to the meeting it is important for me to meet and network with members of the clients team i think it will help me in the long run , and i do n't mind if i do n't know anyone i feel really angry and upset i would gather my thoughts and write down my concerns i would set up a meeting to discuss my concerns with my manager i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i love learning about new cultures and traditions i love learning new things and i would like that i did n't have to travel
i would change my vacation time because there 's no reason to get in a argument it would just cause more problems for me that are unneeded i do n't think it would hurt me much to change my date i would work on the project as much as i can there is not much else i can do i would n't know what will happen in the future so i 'll make the best of it i would go because i would feel that i would be losing on a chance to get a connection with my clients it is a opportunity to get closer it could help me in the long run of things i would be angry because i feel it is unjustified if my manager does n't change his or her mind then i would talk to someone in hr or above their position i will also continue to work hard to prove my innocence i would find it enjoyable because learning about other cultures interest me it would also help me do better with the deal knowing the people i would be working with it is a plus , plus type situation
i would be willing to sit and talk with him about this i think it might be fair if the person who requested the time off first was given the time off i think the supervisor could just make sure that he picks the person to have the time off if my colleague doesn t like that , then they can go somewhere else i would finish the project now i don t like to wait till the last minute anyway especially if my boss has the potential to give me more work before the due date i will not procrastinate this , and get it done as soon as possible i would be happy to go to the networking event alone i am excited about meeting new people , especially if they can help further my career it wouldn t matter to me at my colleague goes or not , i will be there i would follow all of the procedures for the appeal process i would make sure that i go through the proper channels in order to defend myself from these accusations it will be a very rewarding as i go through the process of showing that i am more competent and then his feedback would suggest i would find this very enjoyable i love to learn about new places i think i have some ancestors that come from this region it would be very enjoyable to learn about this culture , and serve this client
i would work around my colleague 's vacation plans i would reschedule my vacation with the agreement that next time they would have to work around my plans i think that would be fair and i do n't see my colleague having an issue with that i would make sure i used my time wisely i would try to get ahead by working on the project every chance i got and not put it off until the end by doing so it would offset any time lost doing other things for my boss i would go by myself i would see it as an opportunity to meet new people or in other words network since that is what the meeting is about it would be appropriate and welcomed i would be concerned about this situation the first thing i would do is try to use that negative feedback to my advantage if i do n't believe it 's true i would just try to prove to my manager by my actions that the feedback was false i would find it enjoyable i like learning new things so it would be a fun experience i would also use my new found knowledge to go explore that land on my own time since i also like to travel
i would ask my supervisor who requested the vacation time first and then ask my supervisor to give the vacation days to the person who requested it first i would respond this way because my colleague does not want to change their plans and i do not think i should have to change my plans either if i had asked first i would start my project immediately incase my boss assigns me another project that needs to be completed in the same time line i would start the project immediately because even thought my work loa is light i like to get important things done as soon as possible i also like to start projects immediately because it gives me extra time to review my final project and revise my project if it can be improved upon i would go to the network meeting because i enjoy meeting new people and learn new ways of doing things i would also go to the meeting and tell my colleague what happened at the meeting because i like to share information that can help other people who did not go to certain events i would also go to the meeting because i think it would look good if my company had at least one person at the meeting one of out largest clients is attending would feel very bad about my manager giving me negative feedback on my work i would ask to have a meeting with my manager so i could explain the value of my work in hopes i could get my manager to change their mind about my work i would also try to explain the reason why i think my work is good then ask my manager to review my work again with the new information i provided about my work in our meeting i would find this project very enjoyable i like to learn about other cultures and new ways to do things i also think it would be valuable to my company if i learned more about our foreign clients country and culture because it could help us customize our projects for our client and make our client feel respected
i would just go ahead and tell my supervisor i was willing to change my vacation dates since my colleague is refusing to change their plans , i would just find it easier not to fight them on it i do n't like drama and try to avoid it as much as possible i would go ahead and try to complete my project as soon as possible i do n't like putting myself in stressful situations , and prefer to complete things as soon as possible this would also make it easier for me to handle any extra last minute tasks my boss may give me i would go ahead and go without them it does n't bother me to not know anyone in a social situation i would hate to miss out on a networking opportunity just because i did n't know anyone this could be life changing i would approach my manager and tell them that i would like to discuss some of the feedback i was given i would want to make sure there was a good reason for my negative feedback i would regret it if i did n't ask my manager about it and suffered negative consequences i would find this experience enjoyable i enjoy learning about other countries and their cultures i'm interested in the differences and similarities of other cultures overall , this would be a great learning experience
i would feel that whoever had scheduled it first should be entitled to it the situation described does not indicate who requested the vacation first assuming that i requested it second i suppose i would have to go along with not being able to take the vacation week by the same note if they requested it after me i believe they should have to work it i understand that they are not willing to change in the situation , but i just do not see a reason for me to cave into that should i have put in for the vacation first i would go ahead and get the project as completed as possible given that the boss tends to give me last tasks that can take a while it could put me in a bad situation if i were to put off my current project the sooner i finish the initial project the better prepared i will be for any unforeseen situations coming from extra tasks i would be fine whether or not they went though i would probably try and convince them to it seems to me it would be a good chance to do some networking in my experience social networking has done a lot for me personally and can be a valuable asset i would feel that it is a bit unfair given the situation i would probably try and present information to the contrary that proves otherwise i obviously would not want this to effect me negatively , so i would do what i could to change that feedback if at all possible i would find this experience enjoyable i have never been to norway nor do i know much information about it interacting with people abroad can prove to be an interesting experience i may well learn something valuable from this
i would change my requested vacation days this would show that i am willing to be a compromising colleague hopefully , my actions will show the correct way to work with other colleagues i would work on the project early this would allow me to complete it in time this also would free me up for any additional tasks required i would convince my colleague to go if that does n't work , i do n't think i would go i would n't want to feel awkward at the meeting i would continue to allow my work to speak for me i would n't allow this little misunderstanding dictate my work from that point on i would n't allow this to control me i would find this experience to be enjoyable i would enjoy learning this about the country and culture it would also push me out my comfort zone so that is a major plus
i would try my best to see if we could come to an agreement about who was switching their vacation i would n't want to switch mine once it was already planned if i was forced to switch i would want my boss to make sure there was as one type of plan created to deal with it a different way in the future example vacation based on seniority i would do as much of the project as early as i could i would n't want to wait until last minute that way in the event my boss gives me extra tasks i'm ready for them allowing me to complete everything on time i would still go to the networking meeting whether i know some one at the meeting or not is irrelevant the meeting is a chance to meet new people and make some new connections i would be very angry i would try to prove why the feedback is untrue if i lost my annual bonus due to something i did n't do the next step would be easy for me i would look for another job i would find the experiance boring i would be ok with it if it involved travel just learning about a culture is ok but i need to experience it to understand it
i would look at different dates to switch my vacation days to i would also plan my next vacation days early on so that i would have first dibs i would also resent my co worker for being stubborn and plan to not help them the next time they need it i would start working on it as soon as possible i know that things come up unexpectedly all the time i would try to finish it and do a good job , as well i would go because a networking meeting is all about meeting new people i would pop in and say hello to a few people and make my presence known if i started to get tired i would duck out after having handed out my business card i would be upset that i was being accused of something that could cost me my bonus i would try and clear my name and rectify the situation with my manager after he has calmed down if that does not work i will try to go over the manager 's head and explain things to my manager 's superior i would find this experience stimulating i like to learn about other cultures and their customs i would probably volunteer for this assignment for the learning experience alone also , i would look like a hero
i would change my date so they could go on vacation and i would hope they could do it for me in the future i would work on it early i would do that so if my boss gave me any other tasks the project would still get done i would make sure that everything was done correctlyi would go and meet people there i would network and get to know people i would do what i could to fit ini would explain why i do n't agree with the negative feedback i would ask what caused them to come to that decision i would explain my reason for not agreeing with them and go to their manager and explain my situationi would because i like to learn new things i like to learn about different cultures and ways of living i would find it very interesting
i would ask my supervisor as to whom submitted the vacation request first if the vacation request was submitted at the same time , then i would talk to my colleague about their vacation plans and how set they are on this week i would do this just to see if they have already made plans that can not be cancelled or rescheduled without financial detriment and if this is the case , then i will change my vacation week to the one immediately after i would make out a project timeline of how i intend to complete the project with a project completion date set prior to when the actual project is due i would then begin to work on the project immediately the reason i would do this is to allow myself enough time to be able to tackle the project correctly ensuring no loose ends and with the expectation that my boss could throw last minute tasks at me prior to the project due date with a set plan in place and written down with goals , i wo n't be overwhelmed and could complete it calmly without issue i would go whether my colleague chose to accompany me or not i would also helpfully point out to my colleague , prior to heading to the networking meeting , that this is one of our largest clients and if they have invited us then it is surely to our benefit i would do this as a way to help convince this person to go as it would be more pleasant an experience if i knew at least one person there i would reach out to my manager and schedule a meeting to discuss the feedback i would be respectful in tone however i would go into the meeting with my counter arguments very clearly lined out so that my manager and i could openly go over their thoughts and i could present my viewpoint i would also be sure to reach out to my manager by email in order to effectively set a paper trail if need be for hr purposes later on i would find this experience enjoyable as a volunteer not only will this give me the opportunity to build a better relationship with this client , it could pave the way to obtain new clients from norway in addition , learning more about norway 's country and culture \( regardless of travel \) is a better way to effectively fulfill the client 's needs and gain a better understanding of their perspective and what they 're looking for
i would allow my colleague to take the week of vacation he wants this is because i do not want to be seen as difficult around the office i am interested in being firm , but not difficult i will allow myself a vacation on another week i would get started on the project and take care of as much as i can on top of getting ahead of the work , i would look busy , which might make my boss consider not giving me an extra assignment plus , if it 's a big project , i 'd rather get it done ahead of time rather than procrastinate and have to choose i would follow in his same footsteps my job is not to fraternize with the clients if anything , i would consider going there to potentially look into jumping ship onto another position , on the condition that i would get a better deal than what i have now it depends i would appeal to the boss one rung up the ladder above her , ask why this is a negative thing on top of that , i would probably change my work behavior habits to avoid this feedback they 're mad about my feedback for a reason , and it 's worth finding out i would find this experience enjoyable , because usually foreign clients mean travel and learning about new cultures and i would attempt to get some travel time , if necessary i like to travel , even if it 's outside the stuffy confines of my home office so i would definitely enjoy this experience
i would talk with my coworker and say that i also had plans and that we need to find a fair way to negotiate the conflict we could draw names out of a hat or , we could also discuss his plans are the hardest to change i would parse out all of the tasks needed before turning in the project and consult with my boss to make sure that we re on the same page i would not want to have tons of work before the due date and i would want to make sure i was on track i would ask for guidance and a little bit of oversight in this case i would try to convince my colleague to go it sounds like a great opportunity and i would try to do explain why this is a professional event it would be awkward without my coworker , but i could make friends and be out going if my coworker did not want to go i would discuss the results of the feedback with my supervisor and ask why they believe those things about my work performance i would offer counter examples of why that was not true i would explain i was doing my very best and working my hardest i would absolutely love to be on this project as i love to travel i have tried to travel as many countries as i can and i enjoy the cross cultural component i have lived abroad for four years and find this most exciting and challenging part
i 'd give in and let them have it because i'm a pushover like that and also because i do n't go anywhere anymorei would make sure to get everything done in case i was given last minute things to do that might require my attentioni would probably find someone else to go with me or else i would n't go either because i would n't want to go alonei would schedule a meeting with him and possibly his boss to go over it and explain why i do not agree with itit would be interesting because i think finding out things about people and different cultures would be fascinating
i would go ahead and change my plans but at the same time i would make sure the boss knew it was me who was flexible and not my coworker maybe it will make a difference when it comes time for downsizing or a promotion i would get ahead on it , bust my ass to get it complete ahead of schedule , and then be prepared for the last minute changes my boss throws into the project , maybe even anticipate his changes and have them staged to add into the project i would go by myself who cares about the colleague , it 's a good chance to meet people who have the power to help me advance my career , and who knows , maybe they might have some more opportunities available to expand the contract i would gather the evidence needed to make my case to the boss if he or she ca n't accept the evidence that supports my position , then maybe i need to find a new boss , and if they take my bonus , i 'll definitely find a new boss i would find the experience enjoyable it 's always good to learn about other cultures , social and business norms etc it would also give me a chance to be an expert on something noone else in the office knows about
i would take the week my colleague did n't want to take i would expect the same treatment when if vice versa next time the same situation would come up i would start as soon as possible to reduce the chances of not being able to complete projects on time i would still go it 's my colleague 's loss to gain that networking experience and further my career i would think my boss is taking advantage of me i would look for another job \( just as i am currently doing ! \) i would find it enjoyable ! it 's nice to be able to do things out of the ordinary learning things about a country and culture sounds enjoyable to me no matter whether or not i get to travel there i'm furthering my own knowledge which will only benefit myself \( and the client \)
i would flip a coin , or at least offer to flip a coin i would n't just back down and give in to them immediately unless they had a funeral or a family event , i would say that i still want to be in the running for that week a coin flip is as fair as it can get i would work hard and fast on this project now i do n't want my boss to throw something at me next week , which would hit me hard if i was n't on a good pace with this former project therefore , i would be moving quickly and not slacking off at all i would go to get myself ahead i would look good just for showing up , and it would put me ahead of my colleague i would put on a good face and try to be friendly to all the people i did n't know , and i think things would work out nicely for me if i kept a positive attitude i would be angry , but try to keep calm i would immediately schedule a one on one meeting with my boss to talk things over i would bring all the data and files and evidence i had to back up my story , and present it to them at the meeting , with the hopes of getting them to realize the truth i would like learning about this new culture and country it would mix things up a bit at work , and it would keep things exciting and fresh i am sure i would get some bonus points with my boss since i volunteered for the assignment , and yet it would also be refreshing to me
well obviously in this case my colleague has made arrangements i would take mine as soon as they came back why act like a douchebag \? i would let my boss know about the time it is taking to complete my project i would ask my boss if there was anything i could do they needed done now in case my project took all of my attention i would then proceed to carry on with my business i would probably ask for a replacement for my colleague i highly believe in utilizing the buddy system going alone would be risky well i would talk to my boss and let them know that this feedback is false if they did n't let up i would go to human resources if that does n't work i would call the news channel i would feel pisaed because they believed it i would find this enjoyable since i would learn norwegian culture in return whether in person or not i would be open to learning a little of their language and teach them mine volunteering at work that 's fun !
i would just accept the fact that i needed to take off a separate time i would realize that there would be no point in causing undue problems i would just try to make sure that i could actually get off the next time that i requested off i would make sure to get the project started right away i would n't want to put off working on it because i do n't want to be loaded down with more projects and then not be able to get my main project done i would want to make sure to not procrastinate because i would want to do the best job that i could do i would try and convince my colleague that it would be a good idea if we both went if i was n't able to convince my colleague to go i would just go by myself i would want to make sure that i did what was necessary to network whenever i had a chance i would ask other people if my manager is right about what he said i would want to make sure that i was actually in the wrong about stuff after i heard that i did deserve the negative feedback , i would do my best to correct my ways i would n't want to lose my annual bonus i would find this experience very enjoyable i 've always wanted to learn as much as possible about other countries and cultures i'm actually mostly norwegian and even have family still in norway so this would be an excellent experience for me
i would probably try to change my vacation plans if that is n't possible , due to having reservations that ca n't be cancelled or something like that , then i may try to pay the coworkers some money to change their plans if that does n't work , then i may just have to skip out on vacation i would try to get this project done as soon as possible since my workload is low , this should n't be a problem that way , if i get a last minute task from my boss , i will have time to work on it if i do n't , then i 'll just have some easy work days i would still go networking with clients is important this way i can do a good job also , it may show that i'm a better employee than my colleague if when it comes time for promotions i would feel pretty upset if there is a way to prove i am correct , i would seek out that proof so i can clear my name if that does n't work , i may ask him for evidence of whater he is saying is negative if that does n't work , i may appeal to a higher supervisor i would find it enjoyable i like learning about other cultures and it would be interesting to deal with these people also , i would love the oppurtunity to travel if it presents itself in the future
i would see if i am able to change my plans i would try and change my plans since the other person is unable to change theirs that way i would be able to work when they are on vacation , and they are able to work when i go i would try to get the project done as soon as possible if the project is done and out of the way i am able to handle other last minute task without having to stress about the one big project two in two weeks i would ask around to see if anyone else is willing to attend the event with me i would not feel comfortable attending an event where i know absolutely no one i would talk to my manager to listen to their point of view and then go ahead and explain mine since it could carry real consequences , i think the manager should listen to my side of things a good manager would take in other opinions besides their own i would find this experience a little confusing i would need to know why i need to learn parts of their culture and what aspects of their culture for certain things , i feel like it might be a waste of time since i am never going to travel there , but if it has to do with our company and a product being used there , that would make sense
i grew up in a home where subservience was the norm and taking the back seat is no skin off my nose my future plans are always made with a plan b so , i would like to be seen as gracious and willing to change my plans for a coworker and for my boss i like to be 'at the ready' to any occasion and would complete my current task as precisely determined by my abilities so as to be ready for boss worthy incidentals doing something out of my comfort zone has fed into my sense of adventure and this sounds exciting i enjoy the avenues of meeting new people and hearing their thinking skills i would go with expectedness likely my manager has a supervisor i would delve into my managers reasoning for the negativity mark and remark about my work and if i find it to be without merit or an opinion only , i would ask questions on his opinions on how to improve and ask to be given a second chance so that the bad mark would n't become a part of permanency i would not volunteer to represent our company to a new client i work better in the background my asset to the company is in being one of the invisible detailers , we shine as a group i would n't find it at all boring but moreso , fearful and possibly enjoyable but would not wish to represent
i would pick a different week i would just change my plans it would be very easy for me because im single and dont have many commitments i would complete it as soon as possible i would want to make sure that i dont have any last minute surprises i want to limit my workload as much as possible i would just go alone not knowing anyone would not be a big deal its important to network for my company i would be very angry i would talk to my boss about how to improve and be better i would discuss things i can i do to be eligible for annual bonus i would find it enjoyable i would get to learn new and interesting things i would also be able to promote my company
i 'd surrender and take my vacation another week then i believe in keeping things chill at work , and not creating waves it 's not a big deal to change my plans so in the spirit of cooperation , i would just surrender to my colleague 's plans i would get it done right away , just in case my boss gives me one of those last minute tasks i believe in getting things done quickly anyway i think it would be the safest option for the security of my job i would try to convince my colleague to go with me , but if he did n't i would simply have to make a greater effort to try to get to know the people there i would n't worry too much about it i might harbor some anger towards my colleague for ditching me though i would feel very angry and resentful about this situation i would talk to my manager , try to get a meeting with them to try to explain things and get an explanation too , and present my case i might have to basically beg not to have any losses for the supposedly bad work i did , even though i know it was good work i love the idea of learning about norway i would be a bit nervous about dealing with a foreign client though , so i 'd make sure to intensively learn about norway i think it would be an enlightening experience
i would wait more time to take my vacation it 's not really a big problem to me i would just wait but i would remind them that they owe me a favor i would work as fast as i could to complete each task given to me i would remind the boss that he owes me a favor if i am not appreciated even after this , i will take this into account in case i decide to find another job i will only continue to work where my work is valued if my colleague does n't go , i might decide not to go or i may just go and meet new people i'm neutral about it it does n't really matter i would confront them about their mistake i would inform them of the reality of the situation and if i'm not treated properly i would plan to find another job i will not continue to work for liars i would find this opportunity very enjoyable norway is a country i 'd like to live and work in i would learn as fast as i can and succeed in my goals with this opportunity i would gain benefits for this opportunity
i would see if i could change my vacation plans then if i could n't i would try and bribe the employee to change their plans and if none of that worked , i would call in sick for a week , and just go on my vacation if they want to fire me they can , because i'm too good for this place anyway , and i 'll find another job in no time i would get everything i can done immediately then i would ask my boss daily if he has any updates for the project i would also tell him that i'm not able to work on it for a certain time , so he needs to get everything in by a certain date i would present the positive aspects to the employee , and tell them that we 'd have a great time but if they really did n't want to go , i would go alone and listen to what was said also , there is always free food and drinks at these types of meetings , so i would n't have to get dinner i like anywhere i can get free things i would tell my boss that he is incorrect , and show him the ways that he is incorrect and if he proceeded to take away my bonus , i would steal things from the office daily until i felt that i got what i deserved i would find this enjoyable it would be different than my usual daily activities also , i would be getting paid to learn about something interesting i also like the idea of not having to travel , which would be a bad thing , since i do not like flying
i would be the one to go ahead and change my vacation plans i would make arrangements to postpone until a later date because my supervisor has made it clear that it would have a negative effect if we are both gone my changing my vacation plans would demonstrate that i am flexible and that i put the needs of others ahead of my own i would choose to work ahead of schedule to allow for last minute adjustments by completing my project ahead of time , i would be prepared to take on a last minute task , if needed choosing to be prepared would be seen as positive by my supervisor and going above the call of duty i would make plans to go ahead and attend by myself the whole point of networking is to build new relationships going alone would show my willingness to step out and make new connections i would feel frustrated about this situation i would feel that it would be fair i would ask my manager to explain to me further how they arrived at the feedback that they gave me and how i can improve i would find this experience extremely enjoyable to be able to learn some new things about a country would be interesting this would prepare me to be able to interact better with the new client
i would have to make other plans i would ask if there are any available times i would ask if i could take the vacation pay and not take the time off i would see if i could rollover the vacation time to a future date i would complete the project ahead of time if possible if i am having to wait on other people to complete tasks , i will have to account for that i would prefer to complete as much as possible in case there are complications i would think about what could be accomplished by my attendance if there is positive progress to be made i will attend i will not go just to be there i would find the true purpose of the feedback if i can do something positive to change the negativity i would do so i have no feelings when it comes to business i generally enjoy learning about places and cultures if there is future benefit to my involvement , i would be more enthusiastic volunteering in a corporate setting needs to be compensated
i would change my plans this time i would tell the coworker they can have the time off , but next year i plan to take this time we can take turns i would try to get the project done asap i would put a great deal of effort into it i care about my work and job i would go with my colleague to the meeting i think i could offer supporti would listen to the suggestions i would try my best to improve the situation i would find the experience delightful i would love to visit another country i think it is exciting to learn about others and other languages
i would probably change mine i am the nicer person i do n't really go far on vacation anyway so it would be me to change i would try to handle the project i would stay late if i had too it may be hard but i will do it it is a bad situation though i would not go i do n't like going where i do n't know anyone i should go since it is our largest client though i may feel bad i would go in and plead my case if i feel i am doing a good job then they should not give me bad feedback if i am losing a bonus that stinks i want my bonus i would try to persuade them i would find it boring i do n't really want to learn about a new country it is not really a good project i would want to push it on someone else
i would be the one that would wait a week the reason being is i would look better and more of a team player if i just bow down for a week it 's not a big deal and it makes me look good i would just get the project done and over with i just dont want to be scrambling last minute to get things done this way i have even less of a work load and maybe screw off at work until the boss gives me something new i would still go because its good for networking the whole point of the meeting i would go around and talk to as many people as i can because you never know who could help you later with work i would explain to him his information is incorrect sit down and explain step by step why the information they have is wrong then i would explain more to show that i deserve my annual bonus i would find it interesting because overall i love learning about other countries it 's pretty cool to learn about another culture most americans are known as being unknowing of the world so i want to be known as the rare american that knows whats going on in different parts of the world
i would try to first talk to my colleague and see if i could convince them to move their plans i would offer to pick up some of their work during their vacation week if they agreed to change it if they were unwilling to change their vacation plans still , i would rearrange my plans to take a vacation a different week i would begin working on the project immediately and try to have the intent to have it completed in one week to compensate for any last minute tasks that the boss may assign me i would make a plan immediately to break the project down into smaller parts so that it could be completed within the week deadline i would request help within the next day from any other departments if needed i would still attend the networking meeting by myself going by myself would be an opportunity to meet new people from potentially other departments that i could collaborate with in the future it would also be good to make my presence known at this event because this is one of my largest clients i would speak to hr about my feelings regarding the matter i would present hr facts and figures refuting the negative feedback my boss provided so that it is documented if i am denied the annual bonus , i would appeal that decision and offer this documentation as a part of my appeal i would find the experience enjoyable because it would be an opportunity to learn about a country and culture with which i am not too familiar it would be interesting to meet the new client and have cultural exchange representing my company it could also be helpful to learn about norway in case i ever decided to travel there on vacation in the future !
i would talk to my coworker and see how can we move or vacation time why because that way my coworker or i don t loose any reservation the we maybe made or noti would make sure the i m organize during the time the i m working in this project that way i can handle any other tasks why \? i m really good in multitasking so i m confident to handle the projecti would try to change my coworker mind why \? i m pretty sure he will go especially if is important for mei would feel terrible and also i will pay attention to maybe what i was doing wrongi would find it interesting and enjoyable why \? i would give me something different to do
i would ask for the reasons why my colleague does n't want to change his or her vacation plans i would then weigh those reasons against my own reasons after careful deliberation , i would decide if i can let go and allow the colleague to go for the vacation or not if i believe that the colleague was being inconsiderate , i would make my supervisor aware of it i would n't want to make a colleague miss his vacation if it was very essential that that colleague goes for it sometimes , it pays to be considerate i would start doing the project immediately because the project is due in two weeks , i would make a plan of action on how to allocate time to the project i would want to do the project in little chunks of time before the two weeks is due while doing other tasks i would n't want to wait until when there is little time before undertaking the project no matter how confident i am i would convince my colleague to go with me it helps to have someone whom one can fall back on when meeting new and important clients if the colleague insists on not going with me , i would do the best research on the client as much as possible i would n't want to go there on a limb not knowing what to say or how to project a good image i would go through his feedback and analyze it thoroughly to see what i can learn from it i would then organize my points on the weak and strong points of the feedback i would then approach my manager and try to convince him to reassess my work output again or to do the feedback again when meeting him , i would be armed with proofs and evidence that the feedback was negative and not deserving i would find this experience enjoyable i have heard a lot about norway and the people by the way , i like having new and awesome experiences i would volunteer to be part of this project while working with clients , i have found few projects that were boring
i would go to my supervisor i would let them know that i had requested it first and that its only fair that i get it i would justify my reasoning because the coworker is unwilling to change any of their plans i would go to my boss several times the week prior to be sure they do not have other tasks that way , i can accomplish them before the two weeks are up i can also have them double check my work to be sure its up to par i would talk to my coworker about why they are not wanting to go if its because they are shy , i would try to comfort them in knowing ill be with them the whole time if the coworker still is not wanting to go , i would go anyways i would be upset i would go to my manager and ask for specific examples of why i got that feedback i would also be going higher up if i feel that it is still unjustified i would really enjoy being on that project even though i do n't get to travel , i get to learn about a new culture i also would be able to learn and interact with others to see how things work in that country
i would first ask another co worker for advice about this colleague to see if it is worth talking to him or her about changing the vacation also , i would has my supervisor what is the plan if both of us do n't want to change our vacations also , it would depend if my vacation was to go anywhere or if it was just to stay at home so maybe i could change my date probably i would want to change mine because i do n't like conflict at work i would try to get the project done ahead of time or at least plan it out so that i would have in place what i needed to do in case something came up at the last minute i might try to mention to my boss if he or she had anything coming up that i might have to do i would definitely try to get most of the work done so if i had a last minute task , i would only have some light easy work to finish up for the project that could be completed easily and quickly i would probably go because i would want to look good for my company also , i do n't have anyone at home so it would n't matter if i came home late i would n't be happy about it , but it would look good to my boss if i went i would first try to understand what the boss meant with the negative feedback i would be upset and angry so i would try to get evidence to back up my work if i thought the boss was wrong i would try to cool off for a day and then meet with my boss to discuss the feedback i would find it enjoyable because i like learning about other countries it might be fun to travel there and i like food so maybe i could learn about the food from norway it might be a nice change from the regular work and it could be interesting
depending upon which of us had seniority , if i was less senior i would definitely change my plans to accommodate my coworker i would mention to my boss how inconvenient it is for me and that i would hope my gesture would be reciprocated if i was the more senior , i would make sure my supervisor realized this and ask to speak to human resources or my supervisor 's supervisor i would complete the project as soon as i can and then spend the extra time double checking i would then ask my supervisor if there was something i could assist with because i do not want to be inactive i would go it would be a good way for me to make additional contacts and would show the client that their business is important to me i would express my confusion and disagreement i would insist on the situation being referred up the chain of command to help me understand or to correct the situation i would enjoy this opportunity it would be a great to chance to expand knowledge base and perhaps lead to further projects this would definitely be a learning experience
i would approach my colleague and ask them when they had requested the week off if i had requested it first i would ask them to reconsider changing their plans if not i would have to take the situation to the next level at hr if i had requested the week off first if they requested it first i would do my best to change my plans i would devote as much time to my current project and try to get it done as soon as possible this would free up time for any last minute requests from my boss if i needed additional help i would consider asking a colleague to assist i would absolutely attend the meeting regardless of the fact my colleague found not go there is nothing that would stand in my way of representing my company especially for one of our largest clients it would be an opportunity for me to become part of the bigger picture i would approach my manager and ask for a detailed explanation of the negative feedback i would ask to have the opportunity to correct or fix what they thought was an issue as a team player i only want to provide the best information that i can if my manager did not offer my a proper explanation or opportunity to change things i would contact my hr departmenti would love the opportunity to work with the client from norway what more could you ask for than to broaden your horizons and learn about another country international experience would look good on my record
if the colleague asked or scheduled their vacation first then they are entitled to that time off since they have already indicated that they are not willing to change their vacation plans i would have to make some changes i would do whatever i needed to in order to reschedule my vacation in the future i would be more apt to request vacation time as soon as possible to avoid this from occurring in the future i would work the project with the goal to finish the project before the due date this would put me in a good place in the event of other projects being assigned during the same time frame as the initial project i would not procrastinate when working my projects as you never know what may come up next i would make sure that i go to the networking meeting and introduce myself to the colleague and explain that my co worker is unable to attend i would thank them for inviting me to the networking meeting i would do everything i could to foster a strong working relationship with the colleague i would ask to meet with the manager to discuss further the feedback i would bring any information with me to demonstrate that the feedback is not justified i would respectfully request further evaluation of the negative feedback i would find this experience very enjoyable i would be interested in learning about norway and the differences between the us and norway this will help build and foster a stronger relationship with the client from norway
i would say that who ever has been here longer should be able to get the week off and if we cant come to an agreement either of us shoild take the week offi would work at it at a faster pace ahead of time in case my manager gives me more work that make take alot of time and if they do i will let them know i will need helpi would ask them to come because without them then i will be by myself not knowing anyone but i would still go either way and make the best of iti would be upset about the negative review and want to speak to manager to see what i did wromg and how i can fix it i would want to show i care and can be betteri think it would be a great learning experience and a great idea to save time and money while learning it would be very exciting
i would change my vacation plans only if i had not paid money that was non refundable or transferable it depends how far in the future the vacation time was scheduled i m pretty flexible usually , so unless the vacation time had an important purpose , i would be okay switching times i would be proactive in completing as much of the project as early as possible it would be beneficial in that i would have more free time later on and less last minute stress or , should my boss assign last minute work , i would still be able to do that with minimal stress honestly , i would hesitate to go alone i m an introverted person with social anxiety , so going to a social function without a wing man would be asking a lot ! however , if the meeting was important to my work or the company i represent , i would probably feel pressure to attend at least so that i am seen sometimes showing up is enough to make an impression and perhaps i will meet someone who is very personable and easy to socialize with i would immediately begin looking for another job negative feedback from a boss that is lacking foundation , is their attempt to either push you into quitting or to set you up to make mistakes which would lead to dismissal i have been in this situation before i made the mistake of believing the boss and not my own gut i was fired a week later for things that were not my fault i would find the experience enjoyable i love learning about culture how other countries have evolved over the years is fascinating it would make me a more well rounded person , more open to the ideas and practices of others
if i could i would be willing to change my date but if i had made the request first and i had serious plans i would not relinquish i would argue with my boss and demand that i get the time off i would just knock out the majority of this project and then just take it easy in case the boss hits me with a last minute project , i wouldnt have to scramble to complete the first since it was mostly done i would try to convince my coworker to go if i coud n't then i would just go myself and try my best i would not help this coworker out the next time i feel betrayed i would immediately want to talk with my boss and find out what the problem was i want to take the opportunity to discuss this i would definitely like to take on this project i love learning about other cultures and would welcome the opportunity i would find it exciting
i would talk to the colleague and ask him her if he she had actually made travel reservations already if he she had not then i would try and talk her him into changing his vacation week to another week if the colleague would still not change his her vacation week , then i would try to change my vacation week to another week i would definitely not get overconfident i would start on the project right away , in hopes of getting it done ahead of time i would be anticipating any last minute tasks requested of my boss i would try and talk my colleague into going to the meeting i would tell my colleague that it probably would not look good if he she did n't go to the meeting if this fails then i would offer to buy my colleague lunch on any day he she wishes , if he she will go to the meeting i would do this because i would hope this would make my colleague change his her mind i would feel angry , upset and afraid i would think about this situation before i reacted to the negative feedback i would try and talk to the manager the next day and have him her show me just exactly what he she is basing the negative feedback on i would probably find the experience boring it is n't something that i would enjoy doing it would feel more like work to me than fun
i would tell him that he can have it and that i will take another week later , the bible tells us to think of others more highly than ourselves and in doing so , maybe he will see that christians are good people and want to help and that will be a testimony to the love of jesus christi would talk to my boss and just explain the situation and say that i would n't mind taking on more work but the project is the priority but when he gives me last minute tasks , it might put me behind on the project that is due in 2 weeks , so either he can give me an extention or give the other tasks to someone else so that i can get the project done on timei would go anyway , because i can talk to complete strangers and have no problem doing so people seem to just open up to me and i am very friendly and outgoing and can start a conversation with anyone at anytimei would keep my mouth shut and just let it go and deal with the bosses feedback , i have learned that its better to be quiet instead of getting the boss upset by saying something that i do n't like as i have to respect him , but i wouldn't like it at all and if it continues i will say something to upper management about how he is treating me , but first tell him and if does n't change , then i would talk to his supervisori would find this project very exciting , i have always loved to find out about other 's cultures and different countries and even languages and would love to do some research and even travel there if they want me to as well
i would just let the other person take the vacation week i could let it go my family would be flexible i would try my best to do all that i could i would talk to the boss and ask if i could get some more notice for the projects if i did n't get more time then i would just suck it up i would still go i would do my best to go so that my boss would be pleased perhaps i could make connections there i would talk to my boss i would ask why the boss felt that way i would ask what i could do to make up for it i would find it enjoyable to be involved i love to learn about new cultures i think it would be educational
i would ask my supervisor if there was any flexibility i would also check to see which one of us asked for the time off first if i asked after my coworker , i would allow the coworker to have the time off , but i would be reluctant to accommodate the coworker if i had been the first to request leave i would handle the project by keeping my boss informed of my progress i would also communicate that last minute tasks may impact my ability to meet my deadline and ask for flexibility and understanding it would be important to me to have clarity about priorities and expectations given my workload and other projects that may arise i would likely also not attend unless there was an explicit expectation to be present my actions would be influenced by whether or not there was some major important deal or project with the client that required a strong relationship , but otherwise i would not want to be alone at an event where i would not know anybody it is important to practice self care and know my limits if i'm tired and need to recharge i would feel upset and angry , with a possibility of anxiety and frustration i would want to quit , but i likely would not actually follow through i would be tempted to be defensive and feel compelled to explain why the feedback was wrong to me , but i would attempt to evaluate whether that would yield any positive results before proceeding i would find the experience somewhat boring as i am not particularly interested in learning more about norway personally i would also be frustrated that i do n't get the perk or benefit of being able to travel and visit the country up it is likely that i would resent the experience thinking about the missed opportunity , but it might be possible that i find some fulfillment from the experience despite being stationary
i would first see if seniority counted and if i had more i would insist i get it if there was a rule if it did n't matter that much to me i would just pick a different a different week i would try to get it finished early since i have more time now that way it would save time for the last minute tasks it would also look good to the boss especially when it comes time for merit raises i would try to persuade the colleague to go and stay a short time if they still did n't want to go i most likely would n't go either i do n't think i would feel comfortable being with a group of people i do n't know i would ask the manager for as much detail as possible to follow up on it i would try to understand what happened and see if it was my fault in some way i would ask if there was anything i could do to correct the situation i would definitely be interested in learning about the country i would love to travel and would hope that it might present me with an opportunity to do so in the future my problem with jobs is they tend to get boring after a while and this opportunity might spice things up a bit
i would explain to this colleague that my vacation time is dependent on my husband 's availability with his job in the military and we do n't have any wiggle room i would ask for the colleague to reconsider if this colleague is still unwilling to change , i would explain the same with our supervisor and then have the supervisor make the final call i feel that there needs to be some sway when it comes to military families due to the sacrifice our families make i would start on the task immediately and dedicate all my time on the front end leaving the last days to either hang back or make any changes necessary i am not someone who procrastinates on my duties \( whether at home or in the office \) and prefer to work on tasks once assigned i would attend the function even if the colleague was not in attendance i am someone who can socialize without knowing anyone i find it important to sometimes suck it up and do things that would be beneficial to the company any our clients i would feel frustrated and hurt i spend a lot of time on things and put forth much effort so to hear negative feedback would be a real disappointment i would ask to have some one on one time with my manager to explain the feelings i have and the thoughts about what exactly did n't work out and what expectations the manager had of me as well as expectations of what would be expected in the future i would enjoy doing this task and learning about a new country 's culture i think it 's important to have an open mind about different cultures for personal growth different cultures can teach people a new perspective on life , or a way to see things differently than previously thought of i would enjoy this task and seeing what similarities or differences there are
i would try to reason with them first i would see why they would not budge on the week in question i would see if i could get something out of it , like they would do the sat shift when i was scheduled if i switched my plans , etc since i already know that something else might get thrown my way i would start planning i would do some parts of the project ahead of time i would plan out the project and time and i would include extra hrs , or days for other projects that might come my way i would ask them to go even for a 1 2 hr so i would not have to go alone they might know some of the people and could help with introductions i would offer to take them to lunch in the next week definitely barter the situation if i really wanted to go to the meeting i would speak with my manager about the feedback i would express that i thought i was doing a good job i would ask them to go over his feedback and how i could do better in each category i would love this experience i have actually traveled a lot to work and been in countries like brazil where i did not know the language i would first find out everything i could about the places i would be going , the language , culture , customs , etc
first , i would find out why they are unwilling to change has it been long since they 've had a vacation \? is no other time available for them because of family constraints or season \? i would request additional resources , such as equipment and people , in anticipation of the additional work i would tell my boss that if the workload expands , then the deadlines should be adjusted to compensate i would ask my colleague whether they could go for a short time , just to introduce me to some people if they ca n't go , then i would ask them to suggest someone at the firm that could go in their place i would say that i want an opportunity to present the good things that i have done recently i would also want to know the source of this information why is it only negative \? i would consider looking for another job it would be interesting i would get to learn about another country and culture i think this sort of knowledge does not have financial benefits but is personally rewarding
i would let my colleague have their vacation this time , but i would let it be known that next year if we are still working for the same company that i would have first choice concerning vacation time i would move up my project by one week , so that if my boss gives me a last minute task , i would be able to handle it , because my project would already be done i would try to convince my colleague to come , and just put in an appearance for a little while , and then we could leave , and maybe grab something to eat before heading home i would ask to sit down with my manager , and try to find out what the problem is i would also request that the manager reevaluate my feedback , to see what can be done to make things right i would find this experience enjoyable , because you are learning new things about another country , and also about their culture , also you would not have to leave your country to do so
i would try to work something out with my fellow worker being flexible is important to me as alternative , we could present our case to our supervisor and let him decide which gets to go usually , however , first come , first served i would immediately try to get the project done , especially if it is very important , staying late if i have to , etc this happens to me frequently at work it may be a good time to get to know the client , and tell your colleague that you can truthfully explain his absence i would research the facts and confront him with it and say why i do n't agree i might also get support from others on this , and see how they were reviewed i would find it sort of enjoyable and possibly push for a field trip ! hehehe
i would most likely take the high road and accept a different week unless i had already made reservations that were not refundable it would n't matter to me if i took another week i understand my supervisor 's concerns and agree that it would be best if only one of us were out at a time i believe that my cooperation would make me a better candidate for advancement in my career path at a future date my supervisor may think of me as a team player , which i am , and a dedicated employee i would handle the project as i always do , with my best effort and concentrate on the resulting outcome i will allocate my time so that there will be adequate time in the event my boss gives my a last minute task or two this way i would be sure that the project is completed a bit ahead of schedule , barring anything unforeseen of course , and also leave some time to deal with any issues or unrelated assignments i would go the the networking meeting regardless of the length of my day it would be an honor to be invited to a meeting with one of our largest clients and it would be foolish of me to pass up that opportunity to meet them and network i would be glad to meet other people , mingle and make new connections i do n't need to had a colleague along with me i would at first be concerned about why my manager thought i was n't performing at level i would take a day to gather my thoughts , review the feedback to see if there was some truth in it , and schedule a face to face meeting with my manager at their convenience i thrive on constructive criticism and would like to get their input and direction at the same time , i would like to discuss what i have been doing right and if it 's up to their expectations if not , i 'd like to learn how to improve i would like to be involved on this project i would find it very interesting and exciting to learn about another culture and country i would especially like it if some travel were involved there is no better way to learn a culture than being immersed in it however , if that was n't possible i would gladly participate in video conferencing to speak to the client one to one to get a feeling for their culture and country which would certainly add to the success of the project
i would talk to my colleague and see if they are willing to change their week i would also try to find out which of us requested the time off first whoever asked for it first should get it i would probably end up just not taking that week off and requesting the week right after it i would start at least planning out how i would do the project today i would want to get it done early , and work on it throughout the next week when i have free time i would definitely want to get it done at least a few days before the due date i would be worried about my boss telling me that there 's something else i need to do last minute i would like to say that i would go anyway networking is important i feel like i would be competent enough to talk to others without my colleague being there , even if it would be kind of uncomfortable i would probably end up being too anxious and not going , however i would feel extremely anxious and probably angry i would try to talk to another manager , and try to explain my side of things i would just be trying to make sure the negative consequences did n't happen when i feel like i do n't deserve that i would n't be trying to get my manager punished , or get back at them , or anything like that i would just want to avoid negatives i would love this experience it would be really interesting and fun i love learning , and i love doing anything at work that 's different , so that i'm not bored to death i like adventures and changes in routine ideally , i would like to travel to norway as part of this volunteer project
i would tell my manager to decide there is no reason why i should allow my colleague to get their way there needs to be a fair way to determine who gets vacation i would get started on the project right away this would allow me to get ahead of the work and plan for any last minute tasks if my boss distracts me i won t fall behind plus i won t be stressed about completing the project at the last minute i would try to encourage my colleague to go i would either try to guilt them into it or bribe them if that didn t work i would still attend on my own but only for a little bit that way i would keep the client happy while not wasting my whole night i would feel upset and ask my manager for specific examples of what i did wrong i would also present examples of my successes during the year if possible , i would also gather any positive feedback i received hopefully my examples would be enough to change his mind i would find the experience enjoyable it would give me the opportunity to learn new things and get paid for it i might even find that i enjoy the culture it s always better to say yes to opportunity !
i would first attempt to move my vacation time if possible next i would speak with my boss about what could be done to allow both of us to work remotely for some of the week , which maybe allow us to take the vacation time but not fall behind finally , i would ask the other employee what it would take \( money \) to induce them to switch weeks i would ensure that i utilized my time most efficiently up front , to perhaps finish the project early if i was able to do so , that would relieve any pressure from a late minute talk if not , i would remind my boss of the project and ask their preference as to how i prioritize i would attend the event i would also encourage my colleague to attend if she does not i would network with new individuals i would be angry i would ensure that i understood the feedback correctly then i would compile a point by point refutation of the feedback , if it was truly incorrect if it was correct i would ask to understand how i could operate differently to correct the issue i would find this enjoyable despite not traveling it would be interesting to learn about a different country it would also be a chance to interact with a different business culture
i would demand that who ever has more senority get the desired week off it does not matter who wins in the end , as long as it is fair and nothing is more fair than getting something extra over someone else because you have devoted more time to the company i would put in extra hours to get the project done i am thankful for my job and want to make my boss happy at every corner that is how you move up in life i would go anyways im not a little sissy girl who has to have their hand held meeting new people is the way to get ahead in life most of the time people in high power positions got there based on who they know i would be humble and keep mu mouth shut i would then do my best to make sure that this never happened again fighting with your boss is never wise i would very much like this experience it really does not get any better than to travel for work and get paid for doing it its truly a win win situation
i would change my plans one i would want to keep the peace , and two he will owe me a favor besides some people , there is no arguing with as they wo n't give an inch i would go on and try and finish the project early that way if the boss gave me extra the project would be finished and ready to go i would tell him i know he is tired as i am but if he would go i would really appreciate it i would ask him to put himself in my spot and point out that he would not like to go if he did n't know anybody either i would be hurt and angry i would set up a meeting with the boss that is over him and explain the situation and tell him how unfair he is being and that i do n't agree with the decision i think i would find it boring i am not really interested in other countries or cultures i would rather see it go to someone that would really enjoy taking part
i would let them take the week off for vacation i can use this to my advantage in the future in case i really need to get off for vacation , as i could say i did you favor before i'm generally a pretty easy going and adaptable guy , i could make this situation work well i think i would try to get it done as soon as possible i'm typically a proactive guy and i do not procrastinate provided that i have nothing else due immediately , i would work on the initial project if i did have other things due , i would evaluate the urgency and priority of each project i would still attend attending the networking meeting would open up many doors and i do not need a colleague preventing that opportunity also , given that this is a networking meeting , the goal would likely be to spend as little time as possible with my colleague because that would not be beneficial as i'm already in contact with said colleague i would accept the feedback and move forward sometimes work situations are not ideal and not up to you your manager ultimately makes the calls and they have authority , the goal should be to meet their expectations , not my own i would certainly find it enjoyable ! i'm always open to learning new things and this is something i likely would n't go out of my way to do if not for work i'm a quick learner and i believe i do thorough research , so this would be somewhat fun i also believe this would better my future
i would change my week of vacation i would also talk to my boss to ensure that he or she is aware that my coworker is not willing to change his vacation plans i would also be more likely to refuse to assist my coworker should any future circumstances arise in which he or she would require help based on the tendency of my boss to assign last minute tasks , i would be sure to allow myself plenty of time to accomplish the work associated with the upcoming project that would allow sufficient extra time to work on any last minute work that my boss may throw my way it would n't be of any benefit to procrastinate on the project and fail to get it finished on time should i end up being buried with extra tasks to work on i would go to the networking session regardless of whether my colleague attends or not this event may provide an excellent opportunity to benefit my immediate work as well as my long term career it would behoove me to attend the meeting alone if necessary i can always rest on the weekend i have very negative feelings about the situation , and would definitely make y dissatisfaction known to my boss had i deserved the negative feedback my feelings would be different however , since i think that it 's unwarranted , i would n't hesitate to ask my boss about the situation the long term damage to my career as well as my annual bonus require nothing less i would find the situation enjoyable , although it would be more preferable if potential travel to norway was involved i 've always enjoyed learning about other cultures , and this project could provide excellent opportunities to learn more about scandanavian culture should the project and networking opportunity prove enjoyable enough , perhaps i 'd consider traveling there on vacation at some future time
i would first see if i could make different arrangements if i had the same time requested off and my plans were already booked and there 's were n't then i would press the issue further if my plans were n't then i could move to the week after or something similar i would get the majority of the product done first since the project is not due for two more weeks i could get it out of the way then i could start working on the smaller tasks before focusing my attention back on the details of the project i would still go the meeting as awkward as it might be , if it is one of the largest clients then someone needs to represent us i would try to convince my colleague and go regardless of their decision i would genuinely explain how i felt about the situation seeing if somewhere along the way something got confused if it is something carrying that much weight and i dont see a problem with what ive done then i need to make that known i would find it enjoyable i love learning about different cultures and taking on new tasks this is just combining the two and even those travel is not necessary who knows it still could happen
i would check to see if my plans can be changed , or if the occasion is rigid in schedule \( simply leisure versus a friend 's wedding , for example \) , and if flexible , i would offer to change my vacation request if my plans were rigid , i would ask my coworker if he or she might be able to change his or her plans if my coworker also had rigid plans , i would try to determine a fair way to choose one of us to change plans \( a coin toss , or other criteria that is mutually decided \) i would complete the project moving as efficiently as possible , preferably completing it well ahead of the two week deadline i would do this because it would be much better to have the project complete and on time and be able to have time open for any other assignments that are added to this one i would also take any free time remaining in the two weeks to go over the project to ensure any errors have been corrected , and any improvements that can be made have been made this will only serve to produce the best product to offer to my boss i would attend the meeting , since the purpose is to network and interact with the client i would be irritated if my work colleague did not attend , as it would be more comfortable to have at least one familiar person , but ultimately my responsibility would be to connect with the client i would strive to improve the business relationship between the client and my company i would initially listen to the feedback and preferably have a copy in writing since i do not agree , i would ask if i might schedule another meeting at a later , but nearby time i would do this so that i could calm myself and review the feedback more objectively to determine if i am responding emotionally , or if the feedback continues to seem untrue finally , if i truly could not agree with the feedback as given , i would follow up with my manager with a copy of the original feedback and my responses to each item and specifically why i did not agree with examples to refute the claim and then seek to come to an agreement i would find it very enjoyable to learn about a new country and culture i would be nervous , because the last thing i would want to do is offend our client due to ignorance of their culture and norms i would hope to be an excellent ambassador for our company and to be a trusted representative for our client
i would try to talk with my colleague privately to resolve the situation i would ask why he needs the vacation at this exact time , and explain why i want to take one that week then hopefully we could come to a joint decision on who gets the week i would try to change my vacation plan timing if it was possible \( if i would n't lose money on hotel , etc \) i believe we could work it out i would complete the project as soon as possible it is not in my nature to procrastinate so i am less stressed if i complete it early also , that would minimize the risk of an unexpected task delaying the project completion it 's just the best way to work i would go to the networking meeting if the client is important to my company , they are important to me i can easily talk to others , even if i do n't know them , and would feel perfectly comfortable introducing myself to the client my colleague is free to make their own decision , but it should not affect mine i would take a little time \( a day \) to think about the feedback and make sure it could not be true it might hurt my feelings , but i would want to be sure my perception of the situation is accurate then i would set up a private conversation with my manager to discuss it i would calmly and professionally explain my side and ask them to reconsider their opinion i am sure we could work it out i would find it very enjoyable and exciting i love learning about different cultures i would try to study a little and use anything i learned in my conversations with the client i might also ask to visit them in norway to facilitate our business relationship i love travel
i would change my vacation to other week it is best to be in peace with my co worker i consider this situation very uncomfortable i would work in this project how i am used to do i am used to last minute jobs that my boss give me this time i dont think its going to be differenti would go even if i do not know anybody my job it's important to me i know that if i dont go i could make a bad impression in my client i would feel frustrated i also would speak with my manager and ask ways to be better in my job i hope it help i would find the experience very enjoyable it gives me the opportunity to learn new thing also challenge myself
i would ask my supervisor who requested the vacation time 1st if it was my colleague , i 'd back out because it 's only fair however , if it was me who requested the time off 1st i 'd ask my supervisor to consider that fact in making his decision i would start working on the project immediately the goal would be to try to get as much accomplished as possible , without waiting until the last second this way , if a last minute task is dumped on me , it would n't be a huge problem i would go to the meeting networking meetings are intended to give you the opportunity to make new contacts , so i would take advantage of it however , i 'd leave early i would be upset , but i would try to think about in an objective way are the comments well founded or arre they off base \? if there is something that the manager was n't ware of in making the negative feedback , i would respectfully try to inform them if it was true , i 'd thank them for the criticism tell them that i will learn from it improve i would find this experience fun interesting it 's always interesting to learn about new cultures ways of living i would n't be interested in moving , but if i could do the job remotely , i 'd be interested
i would go ahead and just change my vacation date i would n't want to cause any trouble i would just cave in and do it so that it is easier i would start working on the project right away in case i have to do more work i always like to be ahead of the game in case something else comes along i would not want to not have enough time to do something i would not go to the networking meeting i do n't want to have to try to talk to people on my own i would be afraid that no one would talk to me i would go to my manager 's manager and explain the situation if i was upset i would like to give my explanation to someone higher up in the organization at least i would know that i tried to correct the situation i would find this experience boring i do n't want to learn about a new culture especially if i am not going there i am not interested in other cultures
i would try to fight for my vacation if i had already plans to travel , but otherwise i would back down and take vacations another time or i would propose to leave it to fate with a fair coin flip i would focus only on that project , make it my priority i would leave aside the rest of my workload to finish as soon as possible , and be ready if i'm given more tasks i would try to convince my colleage or someone else to go with me because i'm really shy and bad at socializing if i go alone i would feel extremely uncomfortable , i would feel extremely bad and frustrated because i do n't think the manager is being fair with me i would try to convince the manager to revise again to see if he changes his feedback but if he does n't and it affects me , my relationship with that person would change i would be happy to be part of the project because i'm interested in that country , so i would accept i would be eager to learn and be happy to travel if the opportunity arises
i would ask the supervisor to do a couple of things check to see if we both followed the proper procedure in requesting time off secondly , i would ask him who requested time off first whomever requested time off first should get the vacation at the requested time i would start on the project now it would be important for me to get as much of the project done ahead of time that would relieve some of the pressure if there was anything that came up near the due date of the project i would go to the meeting since this is one of our largest clients , it is important that we have someone from our office as a representative at the meeting i would also encourage my coworker to go with me i would feel bad about the situation i would also try to discuss the rationale for the negative feedback if i felt it was unfair , i would seek to resolve the situation i would find the experience enjoyable i have been to other countries and i would like learning about norway i find it stimulating to learn about new places
i would be the bigger person and change my plans i have no children so i do n't have that as a conflict i feel like as a single woman , that i need to be more flexible than the family people if i had a big trip planned , and i already paid for it i would not be happy and i would not change my plans i would ask that the person with less seniority change their plans or to be more fair , whoever asked first should get it i would get as much done of the project that 's due in two weeks as i could ahead of time i like to work ahead and not cause myself stress at the end when i have to hurry to finish project that 's when you make mistakes and do crappy work if it was another superior that assigned the project to me , i would make sure my boss knew that i also had that on my plate also i would be professional , i would go by myself and make sure that i am seen , visit with some of the important people and represent my company i would n't have to stay long , but to make an appearance would mean a lot i think the other employee that is not going would not score any brownie points with the boss at work when they found out that they skipped out on the networking meeting sometimes you just have to suck it up and do it even if you do n't want to , because it 's better for you in the long run i would calm down , and take an evening to think about the feedback then , i would prepare my response and if there were any supporting documents or evidence proving that i did not do what i was accused of i would gather those too and in the most professional way , i would request to discuss it with my boss and come to some sort of understanding if you do n't tackle it and talk about it , it 's going to cause more problems in the long run because i would feel resentful about the whole thing , especially if i did n't get the annual bonus because of something that is not true about me i would volunteer for sure i find it exciting i love to learn new things and it would make you more useful to the company to volunteer to be on the project it would expand your horizons and make you look good to your superiors plus , maybe you would get to go to norway someday or get in on more special protects in the future !
i would switch with them if what i was doing was not pressing if it was something that could not be changed , like needing to move a child away to college , i would not switch if it came down to it , i would see who requested off first i would start the project early enough and work on a little bit at the time i may think i will have enough time in the end , but you cannot always rely on that i would try to get it done at least a few days before the due date i would still go because it would be important for my career as well as the company while i may not know someone there , it is important to go to it to grow the company i might be nervous but it would be okay i would work for a while to see if i notice any of the things that they said about me if i did , i would work to change it , and if i did not , i would meet with them again to discuss it i would be sure to be polite because i would not want any negative impacts i would find it interesting because i would be able to learn more about another culture and talk to idividuals in that country while i may not get to travel , there is still a chance it also lets me do something new and have a little more fun
i would probably settle it with a seeming game of chance like picking the dates for the vacations from a box filled with dates it would offer a sense of equal random chance for fairness , so my colleague is likely to accept however , i will subtly rig the box by pocketing the paper with the earliest date and pulling it out at the right moment to ensure that i come out as the victor i will probably work on the task for a couple hours every day , say 1 to 3 i would n't procrastinate , since the boss has a reputation of adding workload at the last minute my goal would be to finish most of the project by the end of day 10 , so that i 'd have a few days' worth of leeway i would probably go to the meeting anyway , since i can still network by myself while having my coworker around is good for companionship , this meeting is about the future of my profession work comes before play , and so i 'd go regardless of whether my colleague goes or not i would probably keep quiet about the negative feedback , and consider the benefits of reporting my disagreement to a superior if the costs outweigh the potential loss of my bonus , then i would n't do it ultimately , it 's sometimes better to keep quiet for one 's interest i would probably find the project with the norwegian client to be enjoyable one of my favorite past times is researching about various cultures around the world via books , news articles , and documentaries while i am well versed in asian cultures , i have yet to focus on nordic ones such as norwegian and finnish cultures , so i would probably find this to be intriguing to be honest , i 'd actually prefer it if i were to travel to norway to work with the client , since then i can partake in the local cuisine and sightseeing in my free time
i would be willing to change my vacation time with my colleague i would do this out of respect for my fellow worker while trying to maintain harmony at the office the only exception to this would be if i had a commitment or money spent on a vacation myself that could not be changed if that was the case i would do my best to work with my colleague and boss to make sure the time and work could get done i would focus my efforts to complete a large portion of the project as soon as possible while allowing time for my normal duties if this required a little extra time i would make it happen because i would want to finish this well within the time frame for the benefit of the client i would still go regardless of my colleagues decision this would be an opportunity to network with people who make up one of our largest clients these connections would not only help our business but my personal career as well it could possibly easier having my colleague there as well but the point of the event is in interact with the clients i would at first analyze the negative feedback to confirm my belief that it was not justified once confirmed i would then build a case as to why i felt the negative feedback was unjustified where possible , and respectably , i would lay out what i had done and the positive results to my manager with the hopes he she would reconsider the original feedback i would find this opportunity exciting and would love to participate the opportunity to interact and learn from somebody from another country would be very rewarding it would also give me greater insight on our clients as well while it is volunteered effort i believe it would help me in my career as well
i would see if i could reschedule my vacation if i could with little negative effect to me , i would just do that and compromise if my plans were all pre set and nonrefundable , i would appeal to my supervisor about all of my investments in my vacation and see which vacation is more of a loss if that week gets canceled for one of us i would work a little bit on the project every day steadily until it was done , and add the other work where i found time to make sure that everything got done in a timely manner if there was any take home work , i would try to get it done in my down hours so that i did not miss a deadline i would encourage them to come to the meeting with me so that it was n't so awkward and strange , but i'm decent at networking and if my colleague was really tired from a harrow day , i would go alone and tell them to rest up and that i would see them soon i would feel somewhat negatively about the feedback but i would do my best to fix whatever what wrong and discuss with my supervisor how i could do better and how i am driven to always be doing my best work so that i can take the best home to my family i would find it incredibly enjoyable and i would hope that it would lead to the opportunity to travel to norway i have always had a passion for travel and any excuse to research and experience cultures different than is an exciting excuse , indeed !
i would discuss with him where is he planning to go , who 's he going with , what 's the purpose of the trip pretty much all those things , also consider who went for vacation last time , is there any vacation sooni would try to do it asap , hand it to him for his review i like to always leave the ball at the opponent s court you always look like you 're on top of things , two or three steps ahead would try to convince him to go with me , at least for a while if i end up going alone , try to suck it up , go and try to make the most out of it if possible , leave after having said hello to everyone stop for a while , try to find the best arguments to justify why i think my boss is wrong then , schedule an appointment to see how can we address this issue that would be a great opportunity , learn about a new country , new culture , and possible language while being paid \? can you ask for something else \? hopefuly make my way and earn a trip there
if i had a good working relationship and respect for this colleague , i would attempt to accommodate their requests if i did not have their respect , i would attempt to negotiate with my colleague i would attempt to obtain a preferred work assignment or opportunity in exchange for my flexibility of changing my and my family 's vacation if the colleague is not willing , i would request my supervisor decide on who gets the week off i would work as diligently as possible ahead of the due date in anticipation of some last minute significant changes i would be proactive with this and ask my boss regularly if there are any expected changes to the project i would be willing to accommodate these changes with the understanding that i am communicating with my boss throughout i would go and use the opportunity to meet the clients i would introduce myself and mingle with the clients i would do my best to meet new people in order to expand my network i would ask my supervisor for clarification on the negative feedback i would explain my point of view while being careful not to accuse or point fingers i would seek suggestions on ways to avoid the situation in the future and ask for more direction moving forward i would seek a mentor from another department if possible i would find this experience enjoyable i would find it exciting to learn about a different culture and how we can work together i would use this as an opportunity to gain a new worldly perspective it sounds like the type of challenge i would enjoy
i would talk to my supervisor first if i had been the first one to request that week off , i would explain that situation to him if i wasn t the first one to request that time off , i would be fine switching my dates i would finish my task early upon completion i would ask the boss if there was anything else that needed to be done on the project i would essentially beat him to the punch of getting the extra work assigned it s always beneficial to network with clients i would try to convince my coworker to go if she didn t end up going i would probably go anyway i would be upset if the feedback is incorrect , then i d want to know the source i d talk to the manager and explain my situation i like learning , so i d be good with doing the assignment it would be enjoyable to talk to someone from norway it would be interesting to learn about that culture
i would have no choice but to change my plans i would be very annoyed however and request the other employee at least split the time so that each of us could have some of the time we requested ultimately , it 's not worth losing my job over i would get to work on it immediately knowing that my boss sometimes adds last minute work would motivate me to get started i would want to be sure i could finish on time assuming i like the client i would go this being an important client i would n't want to risk offending them by not showing up i would at the very least make a brief appearance i would be very upset about this situation i would ask what the feedback was based on and try to prove that it was untrue if that did n't work i would ask how i can make ant necessary adjustments i would probably volunteer to show my boss that i can be depended on to go that extra step hopefully i would find it interesting if it proved to be boring i would n't do as through a job
that would depend on whether i had already booked plans if i had n't then i would change my week to not cause trouble if i already had booked my travel plans i would go to the supervisor and tell him her that they had to decide because we both have plans i would start working on the project immediately so that if i got any last minute tasks i would be able to handle them and not have any other work to do i would try to have the project done before the due date i would splash some water on my face and freshen up then go to the networking meeting it 's important for me to be there , regardless of whether i know anyone or not i would act charming and interested , even if i had a long day at work i would examine what was said and see if there 's any validity to it i would change what needs to be changed but if i felt that the feedback was unwarranted i would go above the manager to their supervisor and show them the feedback and support my case for why it was n't deserved i would find this experience enjoyable it is fun to learn about new countries and cultures it would be even more enjoyable if i got to travel too
i would just change my vacation plans ! i find that in these type of scenarios , it is best to come out and look as good as possible i would take advantage by being the more mature one i would give the project my complete devotion i would be aware that at anytime my boss could add more on my plate , but i would prepare myself to handle it i wouyld make sure that i was fully prepared for anything ! i would try my best to get my coworker to go with me ! i would even make a deal that if they come , i would do something really nice for them ! i would even tell them how lonely and uncomfortable i would feel if they decide not to go ! i would feel very bad about this situation and i would go back and try and process what i did wrong i would try and have a heart to heart talk with my boss and let him know how i feel i would find it enjoyable for a wide variety of reasons i always find it interesting to learn about new countries as well as new cultures i feel that knowledge is power and the more you learn the more powerful you are as a person !
i would be flexible and let my coworker go ahead with his or her vacation plans and i would go another week since by the description there 's no indication of i have already committed money , reservations etc to my upcoming vacation , i should be fine rescheduling by being flexible i would avoid conflict with a coworker whom i 'd have to deal with after my vacation and i would demonstrate to my boss that i'm a team player unlike my coworker who is being insistent a little goodwill can go a long way to keep myself in good graces with others i would try to be proactive handling the project even though my workload is light , from experience i know that things go wrong , the unexpected happens and my boss can throw a wrench in the works i would try to finish the project as soon as possible , working fast as possible since i expect something to come up if my boss gives me extra work , i will be in a better position to handle the unforeseen and less stressed if i am proactive i would go to the networking meeting even though i had a long day at work this is an opportunity networking with clients is necessary to retain their business also , it 's an opportunity to meet and greet people , to have them get to know me and possibly be able to build relationships directly with them in the future this could benefit not only my company but my future career i would feel irritated , concerned and even angry however i would try to find out why i received the negative feedback was the negative perception based on facts or a misunderstanding \? if i feel that there 's an opportunity to correct a misunderstanding i would talk to the manager otherwise , i would try to contact human resources or another manager and try to plea my case that the negative feedback was not correct i would find the experience enjoyable and would want to volunteer to be involved on the project having the opportunity to learn a new language , culture and a country while being paid to do so is wonderful i would also express interest in traveling if it would help showing a willingness to improve yourself to your managers , to learn new skills and being open to new experiences should be seen positively by management as well as helping my career later in life
if it 's really an emergency , prior planned or a must taken leave i would convince my colleague by explaining the real cause otherwise i would take different week of vacation and help my colleague to to take his vacation leave i would try to finish of my project work as soon as possible and priorly would speak up to my boss to kindly not assign any last minute task until my project work is done i would convince my colleague and motivate him to attend the meeting by telling the pros of it because being and getting in contact with the client is very important on getting the future contract from them i would feel definitiely bad about it i will politely speak up to my boss and clear about the feedback if it 's not true also will tell him if it 's true i will accept the feedback if not i will defend myselfi would be willing and definitely accept to be a part of this project because learning and exploring new things will be interesting and enjoyable
i would first try to find out who requested that week first i think that whoever requested it first should get it however , if i do n't have anything booked or my plans are flexible i would just let my colleague have that week i would start the project as soon as i can by starting the project early i can hopefully make allowances for my bosses unpredictability i would also keep him informed about the progress i am making so he knows what kind of additional tasks i have time to take on i would explain why it would be helpful for them to go if they still do n't want to go i would offer to buy lunch or help them with one of their projects if they refuse to go i will just go alone , i probably do n't need to know anyone there i would explain to him why i disagreed i would probably ask for his suggestions in improving my performance if possible i would get him to commit to his suggestions in an email or official document so that he ca n't go back on them if i have to go over his head i would find that very enjoyable i enjoy different cultures and have always wanted to travel to norway all the norwegian people i have met have been very polite so i am sure i will enjoy working with them
i would talk to my colleague once more just to see if he would budge if he does n't i would tell my supervisor i would postpone my trip i would do this because i think that it would make me look better in front of my supervisor i would most likely talk to my boss first i would let him know that i have a project that is due soon i would ask if he could let me finish the project first before taking on more tasks i would explain to my colleague how important this meeting is i would tell my colleague that my job could be dependent on this i would most likely let him know that it would mean a lot to me i would talk to my manager first of all tell him that i do n't think it is true and just try to explain myself i would also try to find some coworkers who think positively of me and tell them to talk to my manager i would find this experience interesting the reason is because i would want to expand my horizons i think learning about norway would also be interesting
i would schedule my vacation for a different week by doing that i would agree to my colleague getting their desired week off however , in the future i will expect to get my desired week off i would tell my boss that i have a project due in two weeks i would also let him know that because of that i may not be able to handle last minute task i also tell my boss that i may be able to handle minor task i would go to the networking meeting i definitely would like to please my largest client i may not stay long but i would at least make an appearance i would talk to my manager and ask what the problem was with my work i would also ask what can i do differently i would then take it as constructive criticism i would find the experience enjoyable i would like it because it gives me a chance to learn something new it is always great to learn about a different culture
i would be upset , but as this scenario is written , i have no choice but to change my vacation i would probably also ignore my colleague for a while , as i would need some time to cool off then , i would take time to try to understand why he she was so unwilling to change their plans i would start to do as much of this project right away i know that my workload is light right now , but that could change at any time depending on what the boss has so , if i delay starting , i might not have the time available to dedicate to it like i do now starting now is safer to ensure success i would not go to the networking meeting the first reason would be i already had a long day another reason is , i am at the end of my career , with just a few years to retirement i no longer need to attend these kinds of functions i would of course be angry at first for getting negative feedback that i do n't think i deserve but then , after cooling off a bit , i would try to see it through my bosses eyes is he she seeing something about me that i am denying to myself that could be if not , is this boss lying about me \? then i would have to consider other things up to even quitting the job i would look forward to this task something i have started to appreciate much more in later life is learning about different countries and cultures of course , the bonus of travel would be nice , but i have learned how to travel in my mind 's eye
i would would have to discuss it with my colleague if i were taking that week off for a specific event , i would try to convince my colleague to take a different week of vacation but if they needed that week for something more important than what i have planned , i would let them take that week i would try to pick away at the project during the two weeks before it 's due i would definitely try to have it done within a day or two before it 's due that way i have time for other projects , or for any last minute changes that needed to be made i would definitely try to convince my colleague to go i'm much better at social situations when i have someone else with me if they decided not to go , i probably would n't go as well i would feel very upset and a bit powerless to do anything about it i would probably focus on my work and try to prove their feedback is unjustified if the situation proved bad enough , i would potentially look for other places of employment i would find the experience enjoyable i enjoy learning about different places and cultures i like visiting other places as well , so if i had to travel for this project it would be a lot of fun
it would be dependent on several circumstances , but if i had already made the request for the time off , the logical decision would be that he was 2nd to make the request and therefore it 's too late for them i would make sure my manager knew this if it were an instance where my time off request were simply to stay at home , i would have no problem simply shifting my plans and offering to do so to accommodate his time off if i had booked travel arrangements \( car , plane , etc \) then i would certainly be far less willing to accommodate his situation and push back i would make sure my manager understood that i had project due in two weeks by discussing it with him as well as its importance for myself and reflection on him in doing so , it would stress that minimal interruptions would be optimal , so that if he came to me with other last minute tasks i could simply remind him of the fact that i had the more important work project i am working on if he asked me to do something very important , i could probably find a way to fit it in , but other , less important tasks , i would ask him if there was anyone else to work it so that i could ensure i meet the deadline i would ask him if he would reconsider so that we would both be able to share the responsibility of networking this would be beneficial for both of us in the end , and it would ensure that neither of us got too stressed out or overloaded trying to engage with the clients hopefully this would convince him to assist me and not leave me to do all of the networking i would challenge my manager plain and simple i would make sure he understood my disagreement with the assessment and validate my disagreement with facts numbers statistics that substantiate the actual outcome and not the negative feedback i would certainly not let the negative feedback stand if my reputation or financial compensation is at stake i would find this experience enjoyable , especially if i would actually be able to do the traveling but even with no travel , it would be enjoyable to meet with the customers from norway , discuss their culture and country , and more specifically their business that they belong to doing so would certainly ensure a well functioning relationship and successful project
i would change my plans i would try to do this now so that if this happens in the future maybe they would help me out i would not want to make a big deal about it i would try to do as much work as i could on it now i would do that because my work load is light now i would want to take advantage of that because my boss is know to give out extra work last minute this way i could be prepared for thati would encourage my colleague to go with me i would like to have them there with me to make it more comfortable if that fails i would still go myself i would not want to upset the large client i would feel very bad and angry in this situation i would try to talk with my manager i would explain my side of the story and see if that would change their mind if that does n't work i would try to go above them to get it resolved i would find this enjoyable i think that it would be a fun country to learn about i think i would do a good job at it
i would first try and see who put in for it first if we both put it in at the same time then i would try and talk to my boss and whoever had seniority should get it off if the boss wont do that , then i guess i would have to change my vacation date i would start on the project even though i have enough time , i would try and finish it sooner than it needed to be done if my boss has a history of giving last minute work , then i would try and have time if needed i would try and convince my colleague to go to the meeting if my colleague would n't go then i would suck it up and go alone getting the chance to mingle with huge clients would give me the extra incentive to go alone i would take some time to think about what my boss said i would try and make a list of examples of things that i have done that would show that i was right and that i do n't deserve the review that was given if my boss would not listen , i would try and go to their boss and talk to them i would love it ! it would be even better if their was travel involved if it was just learning about a new culture though that would be interesting too it would be nice to mix it up at work and learn new things
i would change my vacation date its not worth getting into an arguement over that i dont mind being the person who bends i think a flexible person is more valuable i would also tell my coworker to enjoy their vacation ! i would get started on my project and finish it i would take advantage of the slow period i would then be ready if my boss should drop something else on me its better to prepared for the unexpected than not this is how i would handle it i would go inspite of being tired i would feel like i missed out on something important i would not want to be out of the loop i would offer to take notes for my coworker it would be nice to meet some new poeple i would take the time to gather opposing evidence to my negative feedback once i had the proof of the quality of my work , i would request a meeting with my supervisor i would sit down calmly and explain the reason for the meeting i would counter his negative feeedback by showing him the good work i have done i would request he re do my evaluation i would love this opportunity i am interested in other cultures and the chance to learn new things i am particularly interested in norway i just recently read a history book on nordic culture i think i would do really well on this project
i would talk to my supervisor directly and right away i would tell the supervisor why i could not change my plans i would also show them my travel plans and any proof of my vacation i would work on this project right away i would try to get as much done as possible on it just in case something pops up toward the end this way if nothing does come up i an go back through the bigger project just in case i would go i would go because it would give me the edge of my colleague in my career it would also make me look good to the client and my boss i would want to talk to someone else about it that knows my work if that still did n't work i would ask my boss why they feel the way they do i would feel less valued if this was a big impact i would find it boring if i could travel there it would be fun but just to learn things about the country and not experience would not be the same
i would quit my job , because my personal time is more important to me than a job that wo n't let me take time off what reason do i have to care if it 'll be busy when i'm away \? why should i have to sell my soul to some corporation because , uh oh , things might be slightly slower for customers because there 's less people working i would finish the project at my own leisure if my boss brings up something last second and i do n't have time to finish it , that 's on them i ca n't be expected to finish assignments when i'm not given proper time for them i would n't go to the networking meeting i have no reason to spend \( unpaid \) time outside of work for no benefit i really do n't care about my clients outside of work i would bring up the discrepancy with the manager if they 're criticizing me for something i did n't do , it needs to be fixed and if in the end they still do n't believe me , i 'll bring it up with their superior i would find this somewhat interesting , at least it depends on what i would have to do in the project i have some interest in norway , and i know some people there , so i would like to learn more about it
i would change my vacation this time i would explain to my boss and coworker that if this happens again i will not change my vacation in the future i would make sure to put in for vacation as far in advance as possible so that this situation could be avoided i would do this because i like to avoid conflict and do n't want to create tension at work however , i also want to make sure i do n't get walked all over in the future i would make sure to get started on the project immediately procrastinating seems dangerous even though i have a light workload currently due to the fact that my boss gives last minute tasks , i could get swamped if i wait too long to start the project it 's important to me to make a plan and complete the project i would much rather finish early than late i would try to convince my colleague to go with me i think it is important to attend this networking meeting as it may lead to future opportunities i would be sure to mention this to my colleague however , if my colleague did n't go i would probably suck it up and go anyway even though i would be uncomfortable i would ask my manager for a meeting to discuss the negative feedback i would remain respectful during the meeting and explain why i do n't agree with the feedback i would also ask my manager what he or she thinks i can do better and how i can implement new strategies to make sure this does n't happen again i would find this experience extremely enjoyable it would be a dream project to be able to get paid to learn about another country and culture i love learning about other cultures although travel is n't necessary , if the opportunity arose to travel for the project i would definitely jump on that as well
i would change my plans and schedule my vacation later because someone has to be flexible it would also benefit me to show my supervisor that i'm the one willing to accommodate others and would show that i'm a team player i would get as much of the project as i could done as soon as i could , so if something popped up that i had to do , it would n't mean i would be late with the project i already know what to expect from that employer , and would plan accordingly i would still go i do n't need someone with me to network with other people as a professional , i 'd be fine alone , and i could get through a longer day and rest later i 'd be upset , but i would tell the manager that i do n't agree , and then i would let them know why i would n't be upset , but i 'd then go and compile whatever evidence i thought would help support my argument and give it to the manager i 'd find it enjoyable because i love learning about other cultures i appreciate extra projects at work because it shows that my employers trust me to do well it also gives me experience that may benefit me later somehow
first , i would talk to my coworker maybe we can work something out depending on if i can change my vacation plans , i may be willing to give money to my coworker to change his vacation if my coworker is unwilling and i cannot change easily , i would suggest flipping a coin to determine who gets the week off i would work on the project diligently and try to finish early if i get the project done fast and no last minute tasks arrive , ill be able to resume taking it easy i would n't want to be in a time crunch , if i could just get the project done early i would still go its a networking event , so the idea is to meet new people i do n't have a problem doing events alone not knowing anyone might make it easier for me to meet new people this would make me feel real uncomfortable first , i would try to think about the feedback i was given i would think about why he or she would say these things i then would go talk to my manager more in depth and explain how i feel about the feedback i would ask for examples and justification about the feedback i would find it enjoyable i enjoy learning about different cultures i may not get to travel there , but i would like to meet people and hear about their experiences there different cultures are interesting and i would thoroughly enjoy it
i would ask the supervisor which one of us put in the request first if i put in the request first , i would expect to be given first priority if my colleague put in their request first , then i would choose a different slot i would ask the boss if there were any tasks that i could get out of the way now while my task load is light if there is , i would do those tasks to leave my slate clean for when i want to work on the project if not , i would try to get as much of the project out of the way ahead of time i would still go to the networking meeting it is a great opportunity to meet the clients and other contacts who might prove beneficial in the future this is a work related function so i am not going to socialize i would do some personal reflection to see if there might not be some truth to the feedback if i honestly believe that i am being treated unfairly , i would not feel comfortable in the environment i would begin looking for a new job i would volunteer to work on the project because i love learning about cultures that are different from my own i would try to travel if i could however , if i could n't travel , i would at least want to learn about the language , food , customs , etc of norway
i would probably try to be flexible and change my own plans i usually put others before me and try to please everyone i would want to help my coworker but also look good to my boss i would get started on it right now i would devote a small amount of time to it each day i would focus all my attention on it during the few days leading up to the deadlinei would probably not go if i went alone i would feel awkward and uncomfortable i probably wouldn t make a good impression i feel incredibly upset and distressed i would schedule a meeting with the boss to discuss i would be prepared with examples of my work i would probably volunteer to show initiative i would enjoy doing research and finding out about the culture it would be different from usual work
i would first explain to my supervisor that i had already put my vacation plans in before the supervisor accepted the other person 's i then would try and reason with the other coworker and tell them the same thing if both do not work , then i would go to the supervisor and say that they should decide the vacation because neither of us are able to the reason for this is because i want the supervisor having the power to decide and not us i would start by getting a headstart on the project since i have an easy workload now i would put the work in now before a large task comes onto my plate since the boss does give last minute tasks , i want to have enough time to complete it and not have to worry about completing the big project i had initially this would be the most effective way to finish i would start with my initially reaction which us to ask them to come since it is for a client it is very important to the business therefore , i need to convince them if they are not convinced , then i will still go because it is a valuable meeting to be at i would do this because i am going to try and persevere through the awkwardness of not knowing anyone i would feel difficulty and confusion towards my job i would first evaluate mynperformance more harshly to see if i missed how i performed next i would go back to my supervisor and ask specifically what i dont agree with i need to understand what they are trying to say and see if it is actually true if not , i need to find out why there as well i would find this extremely enjoyable and valuable to my life experience i think it would be pretty cool to do that as a job and future it is valuable because it allows me to learn about a new culture and find a new way of doing business based on norways practices it wo hi old definitely be worth the change of pace
i would speak to my colleague about it and find out why they are unwilling to change their vacation plans and explain my side it would also depend what my plans were and if i would be affecting others going on the trip , if it was refundable changeable , etc if it came down to it and my colleague was unwilling to change his her plans and i was unable to , i would explain my position to my boss they likely could not afford to fire us both , and there are always other jobs out there i would work on the project as if i only had a week to complete it that way i would have plenty of time to complete any last minute tasks my boss assigned i would also talk to my boss ahead of time and try to get him he to assign any other tasks ahead of time if possible rather than waiting until the last minute i would attend regardless because networking is very important not to mention the meeting is with one of our largest clients which would make it even more valuable it could also give me a competitive edge over my colleague i would first talk to him her about it and tell him her that it was n't true i would definitely feel upset if necessary , i would also go above him her and do whatever i needed to do in order to defend myself i would definitely volunteer as i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i love learning about new countries and cultures and would enjoy it even more if i did get to travel my mom was born and raised in another country and i have always been interested in other countries and cultures
i would go ahead and change my date if i have not made any reseravations i would do it to avoid and fuss at work it would be no big deal as long also if it is not last minutei would ask if there was anyone else that may be able to do it if not i would take it if this happens all the time i would go and put in for a raisei would keep asking if my coworker to go try to make a deal with him her exsplain you know no one there and may mess up if i am there alonei would feel bad about it i would ask why i had got bad feedback and try to improve it i would find it boring i would not want to do this if i can get by without doing it i dont really care for learning about norway
i would tell my colleague that i 've had this vacation planned for quite some time and i have n't taken a vacation in years i would explain to them that i would cover a shift anytime this year that they wanted but i really ca n't give up my vacation i would tell them that this is the only chance i get to be with family since i do n't leave near them i would start the outline for the task at hand i probably would n't start the task right away , but as long as i have an outline i 'll be okay i would also ask my boss if there is anything they need from me before i dive head first into this project mainly suggesting that i do n't want any last minute projects , so let me know now otherwise i 'll be extremely stressed out i would try my best to encourage my colleague to attend the event to help me out i would tell them that we 'll have fun as long as were networking together i 'd also offer my colleague drinks at the bar or club after the work event i would write down a list of reasons why i feel the feedback is n't just i would go over them in my head and probably do a google search of what to say to your boss when you disagree with performance reviews i would ask my boss into a meeting and lay it all out and explain why they 're mistaken i would jump at the opportunity to volunteer to be involved in a project in norway i absolutely love different cultures and this would be an experience of a lifetime this would most definitely be enjoyable
i would give my colleague the week i had wanted for vacation i'm not bothered by waiting longer and i 'd rather not cause tension at my job i would complete as much as possible as early as possible without compromising the quality of my work to cross the due date without a completed project would be awful and i'm not willing to risk that by lazing about i would not go to the networking meeting if i do n't know anyone there , being social anxious , i would not feel comfortable and do more harm than good it would n't be pleasant i would feel awful i would discuss the negative feedback with my boss and try to have it withdrawn if possible otherwise , i would take the hit the experience would be largely enjoyable i may experience some culture shock , but learning a new culture would be wonderful i would travel if possible
i would think it would base on who requested first and seniority i would not reschedule mine being in that i had it scheduled first it would effect my working relations as i would be pissed off at the colleague i would get this done ahead of time it would be a priority especially if my boss gives me more to do i hate waiting until the last miinute to do things i would not go either i wont go where i feel out of place and its already been a long day i am not going to want to deal with a work situation i would take it up with them i would fing out why they feel like i have trouble i would be open if i did not agree it would bother me alot i would think it is very cool ! i would love something like this , i find it very interesting
it would depend on why i requested the time off if it was for a family emergency i would try to negotiate with my co worker i would try to talk to my supervisor to see if it could be worked out somehow i would work on the project every day to complete it in a thorough manner i would leave time to address any issues that may arise i would then add finishing touches if time allowed i would go to the networking meeting it would be an opportunity to stand out and meet new contacts and clients i would enjoy standing on my own and interacting i would stop and listen to understand my manager 's point of view at a later date , i would ask to speak to my manager so we could discuss that i addressed their concern and i appreciate the input i would then modify my approach i would find this an exciting opportunity this would be very enjoyable because i am part norwegian i would be very interested in researching the country and culture
i would go ahead and see if it was possible to change my plans for a different week , because my colleague could n't i would explain that although i do n't believe that i should have to change my dates , i am willing to for the greater good of the company i would dive right into the project , because my workload is light at that point i would dive right in , because i would assume that maybe later on my boss might give me more to do , and this way i would have enough time for all of the projects and things i need to get done i would continue on with my plan of going , because networking is extremely important when it comes to my career although i would n't know people , i would still be able to rub shoulders with people of importance in my career i would continue to work as i always do , which is the very best i can do i would then try to find a decent time where i could sit down with my manager and allow them to show me why i deserved that feedback and what i can and could have done differently to receive different feedback i would stand up for what i believe to be true , and if i have to go above the manager , then that 's what i would do i would not find this to be boring whatsoever i would volunteer myself , because i love learning about culture and countries that i have never been to i would find this enjoyably at the same time , because i enjoy learning new things
i am willing to change my vacation because it really does not matter to me when i go on vacation i like to cooperate with my coworkers so this would be easy to do i feel that changing my vacation time is not a huge deal and would make things easy if i cooperate i am willing to put in the time to handle this project because it is important to the company i am the type of employee who is a workaholic anyway , so that extra time does not matter to me i am accustomed to last minute projects and work i would certainly go because it is important to network in today 's business world it does not matter to me if i do not know anyone meeting new people is important in the business world i would sit down with my manager to discuss the feedback and i would want an explanation of the negative feedback i would like to present my side of whatever caused the negative feedback i would request more time for this discussion i would find this experience very enjoyable i enjoy traveling and learning about things to use for this project i would like to work with people from norway on this project
i would change my week of vacation because i dont want to cause any problems to the company , and also i dont want to be in bad terms with my coworker , so i think that is the main reason to change my vacation timei would handle with calm i think i will ask my boss if there is anything that need to be check about my work , so i am sure about the time i have to finish my worki would try to convince my coworker to go with me , it will be a really bad time for me just to go by myself , so i would get my coworker a free lunch or something so we can go together since this is a really important clienti would feel really bad and angry , if the manager was thinking i was not doing a good job , the manager should talk to me about it , so i can do something to improve my jobi would find this experience enjoyable because i love about learning about new cultures from different countries so this would be a great experience to me and if i need to travel i will do it
i would discuss my co workers reason for taking vacation if it was non detrimental and mine was , i would ask for him to compromise for me if mine was unimportant and his was important , i would switch my vacation time i would work on my project as often as i could to finish it as soon as possible i would offer to go together so that it would be less awkward for my colleague i would ask for a meeting with my manager to discuss the negative feedback and find out what i could do to ensure i did n't miss out on my annual bonus i would find it enjoyable to be able to spend time learning about a culture to help the company
i would be upset and probably hold a grudge against him or her i may try to bribe him or her with some sort of incentive if there is no compromise if that plan fails i would be very angry and it would become difficult to work together i would simply have to change my vacation days because there is no getting around it i would approach the project and work on it beforehand i have so many negative experiences from procrastinating which only stresses me out and hurts my performance i would try to plan out steps to complete the project and use the extra time since my workload is light that way if i am approached by my boss and asked to do something , i would have the project complete or only have some very minor changes to make that could be done easily in the allotted time i would do my best to try to convince him or her to go by focusing on the potential opportunities and positive outcomes that could occur i would try to tell them that not showing up could make a bad impression and show disinterest in out clients i would also ask what the alternatives are and what reasons he has for not going i would feel uncomfortable alone as well and i would do my best to try to convince him or her if that does n't work , then i would try to provide some incentive or offer him or her a favor in return because of how much this meeting means for me , for us , and for our future i would approach my manager in private to try to discuss the feedback i would ask him to explain his stance again and the grounds he has to make such an assumption after his arguments , i would present my own arguments explaining what i have done for the company , my strengths and how i have gone the extra mile to meet the needs of our business i would ask him to kindly reconsider the feedback and tell him that if it is not apparent i will be sure to step up and make a difference if he changes the feedback he has left i would also ask other colleagues to back me up if i feel comfortable enough with my manager so we could have an outside , third person 's perspective that is not as biased i would find it to be a very enjoyable experience i love traveling and learning about other countries and cultures all over the world any way to expand my cultural knowledge is great , especially if it is for my business and would perhaps allow me to move up in the company after some time i think that this would show the client genuine interest , help prevent miscommunications and form a close bond that will help the client and myself feel more comfortable the client would also most likely know about the us and our culture so i think it is only fair we meet half way and show interest
if i asked for the week first , i would insist that i get that week also , if i had more seniority or was at a higher organizational level , i should get dibs on the week otherwise , i would let the colleague have it this would seem to be fair i would keep working hard despite the light workload i would talk to my boss about any other items that might come up at the last minute i would communicate openly with my boss about potential workload issues this would be the most efficient way to handle this i would try to convince my colleague to go i 'd point out the advantages of meeting with the big client and the advantages of hanging out with me this outcome would benefit us both i would openly disagree with the feedback i would demand facts to back up the negative comments if none were forthcoming , i would get hr involved i want to protect my interests i would find this enjoyable i like learning about different cultures i would be up to this challenge it would likely help my career as well
i would just switch my vacation plans i do not want to cause any friction at work i also feel by me allowing the colleague to go ahead and go , it would look better on me it does show that i am willing to compromise i would make sure that i had the project due days early i want to allow myself at least an extra 2 days to handle any last minute tasks my boss give me i do not want to be still working on the project ans rushing around with last minute tasks there is a good possibility it could interfere with the quality of my work i would go anyway this is a chance for me to get to know a very important client we have it also show that i care about their business with us i want to show my gratefulness for their time and their business i would ere on the side of caution and try to fix the negative feedback from my manager i might feel that the feedback is false but my manager found it important enough to speak with me on it i want to show that i am willing to set aside my opinions in order to grow as a member of the company i would actually find this enjoyable i love to learn about other places besides the united states it will also serve me well when talking to the client i will have a better understanding of how he she wants things down and how i should talk to them
i would accept that my colleague is unwilling to compromise and let my supervisor know that i will be willing to push my vacation back i think by doing this it would show my supervisor that i am willing to be a teamplayer and would show me in a better light than my colleague also i do n't mind very much having to switch up plans , many times catering to someone else means they are more willing to do you favors in the future i would try to handle this project as soon as possible i think having a light workload does n't mean i do n't need to focus on a project that i have plenty time to do , in fact i would think that having extra time to perfect this project , as well as be prepared for any unexpected tasks , is more ideal the sooner i get things done , the better i would first try to convince my colleague to go , not only because i would feel more comfortable if i knew someone there , but also because it seems like a fun networking opportunity if they chose not to go i would definitely still attend i think not knowing anyone there would probably motivate me to meet more people and become more comfortable i would try to have more discussions with my manager about this disagreement between us despite feeling like the feedback is not accurate , i would do my best to understand why my manager feels this way and what i could do to change their perception or do better as far as their concerned i think showing my manager that i have an interest in living up to their standard and respect their opinion would lessen any negative consequences i would be very interested in being part of this experience i am not very familiar with norway , so learning about a new place and it 's culture seems very enjoyable to me also , the things i learn may come in handy in the future if my company would ever work with this client again
this depends a whole lot on the circumstances of the colleague 's request and the reasons for the vacation but considering only the details given here in this scenario , i would have no problem moving my vacation to a different week flexibility is a good workplace asset and i 'd see this situation as a chance to demonstrate a positive quality i 'd handle it in normal workdays in evenly spaced intervals if a last minute task comes up that somehow has to be finished before the project deadline i 'd log overtime and take time off post deadline if management assigns tasks in an irresponsible manner repeatedly and continuously , interfering with project deadlines without good reason , i would consider looking for a position elsewhere if my colleague ends up going , i would probably not accompany them if my colleague decides against it , i would not care much whether i know anyone there or not , they know my firm , that 's sufficient and i would be very much leaning towards going however , after a long workday , considering this is an impromptu invite , i would base the decision whether to go or not on pragmatic factors , such as how far to the meeting location , how far from there home , attire \( do i need or have a change of clothing at hand or do i have time to go home and back \) , whether i 'll have a chance to grab a bite in between or even at the meeting etc wow i would not feel good about a situation like this and inevitably would question their motives and reasoning i would definitely ask for a meeting to clarify the reasons for the feedback and base further action on the outcome of this meeting i would love to learn more about norway ! i 'd volunteer to be involved if the task is within the scope of my abilities and i would most likely find the task very enjoyable \( unless the project is entirely made up of extremely unexciting routine work \) i 'd also volunteer to travel , even in winter i 've never been there and i like new experiences
i would not be willing to change my vacation plans either neither one of us is entitled to a vacation over the other i would rather leave it to my boss or even flip a coin to see fair is fair i would get prepared knowing that i might have another task dropped on me even though i have a couple weeks left to finish the project i would get on completing it as quickly as possible i'm not sure that i would spend a lot of time outside of work on it but i would n't be opposed to setting aside a couple nights this to finish it up at home if i had n't at work yet i would end up going with the intent that if within the first half hour of being at the event i had n't connected with anyone than i would leave i have had a long day but also know this could be a huge opportunity for me i might try and talk my colleague into going with maybe bribing them with something i would first , call my husband and talk over everything with him he can be the calm in a storm for me so even though i am upset and believe the feedback was wrong i'm still going to give this some thought and come back tomorrow with a solution i would try talking with my manger the next day once more and if that does n't get me anywhere i would go to the next person in charge i would find this project to enjoyable learning about other cultures for work would be awesome it 's not everyday that everyone gets to be involved in something like this and there could be a possibility of traveling to norway , you never know
i would hate it but i would understand if this request involved an event like a wedding i would ask if i could have one or two days off and offer to work overtime when i returned i would choose a different week but be ready next year to put in my vacation requests as soon as i was allowed to i would try to get as much done as soon as i could in anticipation of some last minute tasks i would probably invest some extra time like evenings or weekends on it even if i did n't finish i would know that i'm on the tail end of the project and could probably handle the extra work with some overtime i would check with my supervisor to see if it 's worth it for me to attend alone if he says yes , then i would go for a short time just to be seen if he says no then i would skip it i would think about it , and ask for another meeting to discuss again i would try to make my boss understand that i will work on correcting the situation or learn the skill \( whatever the basis of the feedback was \) but to please not put in my file where my bonus or future opportunities could be impacted i would have a plan ready to share with my boss i would enjoy this project i love to travel and learn about different cultures although there is no immediate plan to travel there it could come up in the future and the person who worked on the project would probably be chosen
i would try to work to change my vacation if possible if not , i would ask my boss if we could use tenure as a way to break the tie on the vacation week worst case i would have to work and look good knowing i was the bigger man i would jump on the project immediately by getting it done right away it would allow some buffer time for additional projects if those projects did not arise , then i would have time to check the project further for items that could be improved i would attend regardless meeting with a large client in a networking setting is important for business if my colleague did not attend it would also make me look better for trying to build relationships first of all i would be very upset i would spend time working to counter the feedback if i felt it was unfounded , it would be important to provide proof to show why it was incorrect i would find it enjoyable learning about a new country in order to build a relationship with a client would be interesting being able to speak about their homeland in interactions would make our relationship better
i would just let them take their vacation i can always take mine on a different week if their plans are that fixed and they are not willing to change , then it is n't worth it for me to fight over who takes vacation when i'm a fairly flexible person as it is i would start on the project early in case my boss gives me last minute tasks that take a lot of time i would want to be as prepared as possible for anything that might be coming my way i also feel its best to get things done as soon as possible rather than wait until the last minute you never know how your schedule might end up having to change to fit other things in i would go to the networking meeting even though i would be on my own it would give me a chance to meet new people among one of our largest clients and hopefully make a good impression it would also give me a chance to hopefully make a good impression for the company i work for i would keep in mind his feedback and set up a meeting later with him to go over everything i would make counterpoints to what he said , so he can see why he may have been wrong in the end , it would be better for me to try to work something out then to completely lose my annual bonus at the very least , i will know exactly what to work on for the upcoming year i would find this enjoyable because i like learning new things getting to learn new stuff about a country and its culture would be interesting to me , and it would provide me with more knowledge it would also make me more relatable to the client and show that i care greatly about the project
i would request to my supervisor to look into who made the request first to take this week off for vacation if my co worker put in the request first i would be okay with changing my week if i were the one to submit the request prior to my co worker then i would request that being taken under consideration and i would refuse to change my plans since i already know that my boss does sometimes give me last minute tasks i would go ahead and begin work on the project now instead of waiting since my current work load is light this would give me ample time to get the work load completed or at least get a good start just in case any unexpected tasks arise i would definitely still go because it is one of the largest clients i would want to show initiative to my boss that i'm a team player another co workers decision not to go would not effect my decision just because i do n't know anyone else because by my deciding to go it would definitely look better on me in the long run i would ask more questions to my supervisor as to what made them come to the determination that the feedback they are providing is accurate if they were n't willing to re think their decision i would go to a management member above my supervisor to try to appeal this decision and explain why i believe the feedback is incorrect i would find the experience very enjoyable because it would be nice to travel to a place like norway that i had never visited even though i would be going for work it would be a new experience that i may not get to have otherwise
i would also not be willing to change my plans i already the trip planned and my husband took the same time off i would talk to my boss and make a case for my time off i would put all of my effort into this task i would want to show my boss that i can do anything i do n't have much other work to do , so it would be easy to put in a lot of effort i would probably not go to this meeting i do not like feeling forced to do extra things , especially at the last minute i would not miss out on much , and being home with family is more important i would feel annoyed at this situation i would do some research to find the facts to prove my boss wrong i would find supporters and fight for what is right for me i would find this enjoyable i like learning about other cultures , and just learning new things in general i would also hope that this would come with the possibility of travel because i would find that fun and educational
i would most likely change my vacation , depending on what my plans were i would ask who requested it first because i think it is most fair if that person gets the week off however , realistically i would probably be passive and avoid conflict with the stubborn coworker i would try to do as much as i can ahead of time to leave room at the end for last minute task more realistically i might not adhere to that because i tend to be motivated mostly by deadlines however , i would also try to talk to my boss as the two weeks go by to ask if there is any task she is thinking of adding i would probably go depending on what else i had been planning to do i am an extroverted person and it sounds like this would be a helpful event even when i 've had a long day interacting with other people tends to energize me i would feel very upset and frustrated if there is somehow above him her in the hierarchy i would try to go to them with evidence that i should have received more positive feedback i would probably cry and complain to friends and family i would find the experience enjoyable i like learning about different cultures and countries it also seems as though it would be an important deal so that would add significance i would find it even more enjoyable if i got to travel
i would probably just change my plans vacations can be taken almost anytime rather than upset the apple cart , i would prefer to keep peace in the workplace i would handle the project to the best of my ability my job , along with family , is the most important thing in my life i would want to prove to my boss that i can get things done no matter how long it takes i would go since it is part of my job i would n't want to get in trouble with my superiors it might be a good opportunity to meet the right people to further my career i would go to my manager and discuss the matter i would want to know first if it is true then , if it is true , i would want to do whatever necessary to correct the problem situations can sometimes be reversed i would find it quite interesting i would relish the opportunity to do the research i believe it would be an enjoyable experience to learn about another country and their culture
i would first talk to my coworker and try to convince them why i need the week of and see if they can move failing that i would look at my own plans and see if i would be able to move if neither of us were willing to move our vacation i would see if we could work out something with the supervisor where we could do some work in advance otherwise neither of us should get the week off i would begin getting the outline of the project together and all of the resources needed i would make a plan to get the project done within the next week if i make a plan to get it done in the next week that would leave a week cushion to plan for anything unforseen it would also allow a cushion in case my boss gives me any last minute tasks that require attention i would first try to convince my colleague why it would be a good idea for both of us to go even if they chose not to go i would still go because it would be great for my career it would give me a chance to network and learn more about one of the clients largest clients i would feel pretty upset and angry and would want to resolve this issue i would first try to schedule a meeting with my supervisor to discuss these issues in more detail if i could not resolve it with my manager i would seek to talk to his manager and explain my concerns if nothing else worked i would take the issue to human resources and lodge a formal complaint i would very much enjoy being part of this project i do not know much about norway but enjoy learning about different cultures it would be a great opportunity to learn about norway , and i could have the opportunity to travel to norway
if i had not planned my vacation yet , it would be easy for me to take another week off instead if i had non refundable deposits i would be upset and see if the boss would work with me if my vacation was approved ahead of time then this would be a situation for management to handle , not leave it up to two co workers i would get as much done as possible early on this way if my boss adds on to my workload at the last minute i will have more time to keep working on the new project this would make sure i can get everything done in time without having to rush i would for sure go anyways networking can be important to growing my business goals not going to this meeting because i wo n't know anyone is a poor excuse and makes the perfect opportunity to get to know more people i would be upset with the outcome but i would try and schedule a meeting with my boss in the meeting i would ask if there was anything i could do to improve the project and make sure there was no miscommunications between the two of us i would hope the boss would be understanding and want to work with me to improve i would find this enjoyable because it is always nice to learn about different cultures it would be fun taking the time to research norway to see what type of place your clients grew up in and any type of traditions that their culture participates in it would be nice incorporating their traditions into my project
i would not be willing to change my vacation plans why should i \? the supervisor can do their job and make the decision i would get the work done as soon as possible i like to hedge my bets in case my boos gives me last tasks i have nothing to lose by finishing my project on or ahead of time i would not go because i have social anxiety disorder the given situation could bring on a panic attack even under the best circumstances i am unlikely to go at all i would make an effort to get more detail from my boss on their position i would try to state my position and see if there is any movement if not , i would start looking for another job i would enjoy this experience because i would like to fantasize about being in a decent , liveable country it would be great if it could lead to me getting out of this country , maybe even permanently in any case , i like learning about other places
i would be willing to switch vacation days because they are not willing to change their vacation and there is no reason to try to make my supervisor make them change it would be easier if i just changed it and then chose another vacation day that i would like to take i would be very unhappy if my supervisor were to choose me to take the vacation if they were brought into it and i would rather maintain control over the situation i think it would also look better on me for being willing to switch and might help me in the future i would put this project as a number one priority on my to do list and focus on getting it done and work late nights if i had to if my boss gave me every work i would try to negotiate to have the projects he or she gives me pushed back or given to someone else i might even reach out to other coworkers for guidance and help with the project i would still go because although i might not know anyone at first , i might leave the network meeting at the end with new contacts that will be beneficial to me in the future i would be afraid if i did not go then i might also lose the opportunity to ever meet those people again i think it is better to take a chance and be brave because it might all turn out alright in the end i might also invite another coworker that might be interested but i would still go alone if i had to i would feel very upset and angry at the situation i would also be angry at my manager i would repeal the feedback and provide argument for why it is not accurate if they still did n't listen i would then bring in a 3rd party \( perhaps hr \) to help i would find this experience interesting and enjoyable because i am part norwegian also i like learning about other countries and their culture i think it would also be good experience to work on other projects outside of the norm
i would first consider what i had planned for vacation and if i could change my plans if i could change my plans i would go ahead and change my vacation if i could not change my plans and had been the first person to request the vacation i would demand that i get my vacation or the company would need to pay any cancellation fees that resulted from having to cancel the vacationi would work hard to get the project done early that way if i was given unexpected work i would have time to do it and i wouldn t miss my deadlinei would find out if anyone else from my company was going so i could go with them if not i would still go considering it s an important clienti would gather physical proof that the feedback that was given to me was false and present that to the manageri think it would be a new experience and i would enjoy learning more about a new culture
i would talk with my colleague to see if he she would consider changing vacation weeks i would explain why i needed this particular time so he she would be more willing to select a different time if that did not work , i would speak with my supervisor to see what other weeks were available and plan accordingly i would take immediate steps to complete the project well before the due date i would make the project my priority and look to complete the work as soon as possible i would devote my time to completing the project well before the deadline and ask my co workers for assistance if i needed help this way it would n't matter if my boss gave me a last minute task as the project is already finished i would remind my colleague how important the client is to the firm and to our jobs i would assure my colleague that we did n't have to stay long , just make a meaningful appearance so the client knows we were there if my colleague refuses to go , i would go to the networking meeting alone i feel very betrayed and hurt by my manager 's actions after calming down , i would approach my manager about having a meeting to discuss the negative feedback i would find out why my manager gave me the negative feedback then present my side of the story if my manager refused to change my feedback , i would take the matter to hr i would find it very enjoyable i would volunteer for the project and start learning about norway i would visit the library to check out the appropriate books and go to the bookstore to find additional materials to learn about norway
i would volunteer to change mine i would tell the person that next time is my turn i would have them commit to that 'deal ' i would tell my supervisor of our arrangement i would put it on the front burner i would let my supervisor know what 's on my plate i would provide status updates if more work given , i would let them know priority if it is an essential client that requires a presence , i would go i would have colleague agree to go next time i would attend meeting i would have cocktail and few finger foods i would ask the manager for a meeting i would take feedback and construct a positive response i would discuss with manager i would have them agree to my terms i would volunteer for this project i would push for a norway trip you know , to learn firsthand about the client i enjoy other cultures it would be exciting
i would first try to reason with my colleague and find out why they would n't change their plans next , i would see if i could push my own plans back a week , so that my colleague would have their time off and finally , if i could not , i would get the boss involve and have them award the time by seniority i would start on my project right away , to make sure it was done in plenty of time that way if my boss does give me last minute tasks i will have enough time left over to get them done too however , starting early also means i can take my time with it and work at a more leisurely pace i would first ask my colleague to go with me , and explain to them that if they do n't come i will not know anyone there then , if they still do n't want to come tell them that i am going anyway in hopes they change their mind finally , if they do not change their mind , i will go anyway and try to make new colleague friends so this situation does n't happen again i would be very upset with this , and would promptly bring this up to the boss questioning why they felt that way as i did n't see it that way then , if they still refused to change it , i would contest it and reach over their heads to upper management finally , if nothing changed i would just work harder and be extra ontop of things in the future so there would be no more negative feedback i would jump at this opportunity and find it enriching and enjoyable i would be eager to learn some things about such a wonderful country and culture and immerse myself in the project as for why , it 's because i am someone who loves to learn new things as every new day is a learning experience !
i would do my best to change my vacation plans , as long as i had n't already booked something that could n't be refunded i would try to be flexible since my coworker is not being flexible i would feel frustrated , but i would do my best to make the situation work out for everyone involved i would work hard on my project right away , putting as much time and effort towards it as i could that would allow me to make sure i was as prepared as possible for the project , and it would also ensure that if my boss gave me time consuming last minute tasks , i would hopefully have the capacity since i had already done a lot of work on my project i would do my best to not leave any important parts of the project until the last minute i would choose to not go to the event either i do n't enjoy situations where i do n't know anyone , and i do n't think i would be particularly interesting in interacting with others after a long , busy day at work and with no one else there that i knew i would feel a bit guilty about choosing not to go , but i would be happy to go home and rest rather than spend the night at an event i likely would n't enjoy without knowing anyone there i would feel frustrated and disappointed by the negative feedback i would ask my manager for reasoning behind the feedback , and i would ask to have a longer conversation about what led him or her to reach these conclusions i would ask if we could talk about it and see if i could make my case for what i felt was a more accurate representation of me and my work i would be careful , though , to not argue or fight about it and would only pursue these actions if i knew they would n't reflect poorly on me i would find this experience enjoyable i find it interesting to learn about different cultures , and i would love the opportunity to not only learn about another culture , but to be able to help my company through that learning it sounds like a fun way to learn some new things and meet some people from another country
if i worked some place that i had more seniority , i would simply object to their vacation if not i would try to talk with my colleague i would try to reason with them as to why they should change their plans if their reason is more valid than mine then i would change mine knowing that my boss gives last minute projects , i would prepare myself i would start the project right away i would make sure to have it done early to accomodate other projects i would still go if this is one of our biggest clients then our company should be represented i wouldn t worry about not knowing anyone it s more important to be there for the company and the client i would ask for a private meeting with my boss i would explain the situation if i had any proof of this mistake i would calmly bring it to their attention i would ask at this meeting if there will be any consequences due to this i would find it very enjoyable i like learning new things about other cultures i may be a little intimidated if i had to learn some of their language but overall i would be excited to learn new things about their culture
the first thing i would do is reflect on what type of vacation it is if i already have previous engagements at a place , then i would talk to my colleague and try to negotiate something if i did not have previous engagements , then i would talk to my colleague and probably change the times around to work with my supervisor 's schedule i would plan my time out for days leading up to the project for instance , i would schedule a certain amount of hours a day to work on the project and outline the most important things to be done first that way if something heavy is thrown onto the plate , i can spend less attention on the less important parts of the project and juggle both at the same time it would depend on how important this client is i would probably go anyways , and just try my best to get to know someone else i would assess what i know to be true , but also accept the feedback regardless of how perfect someone is , there is always room to improve i would use the feedback to benefit myself by taking the pieces of it that i need i would find this experience incredibly enjoyable ! traveling , experiencing different cultures , learning about new languages and cultures has always been interesting to me !
i would ask my colleague if they have plans that can be changed without penalty if so , i would try to convince them to take a different week i would tell them that i 'd be willing to help them out with their workload in exchange i would definitely take advantage of the fact that i have two weeks by getting an early start since my boss can sometimes give me last minute tasks that take a lot of time , it would be in my best interest to accomplish as much as i can on my project i have two weeks so i would use that time wisely i would try to convince my colleague to go i would express how this could be a good move for the both of us if that did n't work , i 'd tell the truth and say that i did n't want to go alone because i would n't know anyone i would feel devastated i would ask my manager if i could talk to him her about the recent feedback i 'd tell him her that i do n't agree with it and why i would be very excited to take part in this project it would give me the opportunity to learn about a different country and culture this would be appealing because it 's different from what my work usually requires
i would gladly change my plans i like to be cooperative and considerate changing around vacations days to accommodate someone else is an easy way to prove friendship and camaraderie i would handle this project aggressively i would go in early and stay late until it was finished i would want to be prepared for last minute tasks so that i was able to accomplish everything on time i would go to the meeting and put my best face forward it is important that we represent at this event i would not be pleased , but i would suck it up and go i feel sad and disappointed i am also somewhat fearful for my future however , i would accept this feedback and try to improve i would find this experience enjoyable and exciting i would love to take on a new experience and learn something new i would enjoy the research and feel like a bigger person at the end of it
it would depend on if i already booked my vacation or not if i already had something booked , i would let my boss know that i have plans that ca n't be changed otherwise , i think it would be easy to plan a vacation a different week instead i do n't want to appear too inflexible i would get up work on it right away if my workload is light , then i have time to work on it that would also make it so i could take on other projects and not disappoint my boss without getting overwhelmed i would go it might be a little bit uncomfortable , but i think it would be valuable to at least show my face i do n't have to stay long , just make a couple rounds it would reflect well on my work ethic , and it would make me look more committed than my colleague i would feel really upset i would probably discuss it with another manager who knows my work to see if the is anything i can do to improve the situation i would feel really ripped off if i lost my bonus over something that was false i would find it enjoyable it would be interesting to learn about the culture it could also open the door for future opportunities with this client and i 'd be the go to person
i would be upset at the other colleague i would try to reason with the other colleague i would end up changing my own plans i would work hard on this project to finish it early i would then be able to handle any last minute tasks that may be assigned to me if i had completed the project ahead of schedule and was not assigned any additional tasks , i would take extra time to check and revise the project if needed i would try to convince my colleague to go i would try to bribe my colleague to go i would end up going either with or without my colleague i would ask my manager for additional information as to why the feedback was negative i would ask my manager to help me devise a plan to avoid any future negative feedback i would be willing to revise any of my work to correct any mistakes that i may have made which lead to the negative feedback i would find this experience enjoyable i would learn things about the country and culture i would even be willing to do some traveling
i would take my vacation as well i am just as deserving as everyone else in the workplace i am not a tool to make money , i am a human being i would approach my boss for resources that will help me the worst that he can do is not have any information i will utilize my full potential and drive steam forward and accomplish it i would go network regardless of my colleague this is an important oppurtunity for me and i cant halt myself for someone else if they do not want to go , that is their decision , not mine i would see how could i improve my weaknesses constructive criticism is not what i want to hear , but what i need to hear i will make sure i am taking this chance to better myself at my workplace i would agree that unfamiliar things may seem undesirable at first however , as you become less ignorant , you realize there is rich culture all around i would keep an open mind as i work with the client
i would simply base the decision on who gets the vacation time approved , on who submitted the request first it makes sense that whoever has been planning for vacation longest should get it it 's unfortunate , however , that both of us ca n't go due to work needs hopefully in the future there will be enough employees to accommodate these types of requestsi would prioritize the main project that 's due any smaller tasks that are sent my way can be pushed to the backburner , or handled as necessary it 's important to get the big job done firsti would probably still go , alone the point of networking is getting to know new people going alone would really make me feel in the moment and on top of things , socially i would respond to my feedback , one on one with my management it 's vital that i express my point of view in the matter , so that i can be rewarded appropriately i put in the necessary work , and i value my job , so it 's important to stand up for myselfi would find this experience enjoyable i am very interested in traveling abroad , so researching a destination that i have not been to is something that i would probably be doing in my free time anyway this would barely even feel like work to me
i would inquire as to who requested the vacation first it seems that it would be fair to give the vacation week to the person who asked first i would agree to give up the week if my coworker requested it first i would handle this project by trying to stay ahead on my work this would allow time to work on last minute tasks from my boss i would also let my boss know about the project if i needed time away from his last minute tasks i would encourage my colleague to attend the meeting with me if my colleague will not go i would still go i think this meeting is important and is worth attending even if i do not know anyone there i feel very upset about this situation i will ask my manager if i can respond to the feedback in writing or some way that will stay with my file i would fight to have this issue resolved i would find this experience enjoyable it would be challenging but it would not be boring it is always fun to learn new things about other cultures
i will still go on vacation because it is my right i will not care if someone is there or not it is my right and my colleaugues right so the company can cover up for both of us somehowi would refuse to take any other work that could take more time than i can handle and will let the manager know that he she needs to know what is more important and i will work only on the main projecti would try to convince my colleague to go with me to the meeting because it will benefit both of us if he did not go , i will still go because this could be a great thing for my carreer and will not waster it i may bring a plus one with me if allowedi would feel really mad and frustrated i would go to the manager right away and stand up for myself if he does not listen i would go the district manager and i will make sure i get my message accrossthis would be interesting to me i would like to learn more about other cultures sometimes the only way to learn is by being forced to learn i will take that oppurtinity to learn more about the culture
i would attempt to get my colleague to change their plans i probably have been planning this trip and would be devastated to lose out on my vacation plans i would then try to negotiate with my colleague if they are still unwilling to cooperate i would absolutely get this project done as soon as possible i like to dedicate enough time to tasks to make sure they are completed well if my boss gives me any extra work , having my project already completed will allow me to focus on those additional tasks without being overwhelmed i would likely also lean towards not going if it has been a long day at work and my colleague is not going i would also likely not go i would graciously thank the client and make up an excuse why i'm not available i would ask the supervisor to reconsider her evaluation i would prepare a list of reasons and evidence as to why her initial evaluation was incorrect and present this to her i would feel angry and upset if she would not re evaluate me i would find this experience enjoyable i am interested in other parts of the world and would like to learn about that culture i would gladly offer to be a part of this project
i would make the decision for the vacation for the same days , but the colleague is not convince to change their plans because of their plans are very actively affairs for the family and the many of function related situations but my purpose is only for the family and spend vacation time for the friends and the some of the travel destinations so kindly i can change the timing and the activity of the my plans in the vacation timing and delivers some of the decision for the colleaguei would handle the project in the best way and the effect of me as possible in the good way it delivers some of the good impression to me in the office with my boss and delivers the some of the good impression and makes some of the attention and the performance of the things and makings of the good activity in the boss it delivers some of the good impressions and makings of the good attitude from the boss so i demand the work and do the work in the correct way and the punctual timei would take the situation very easily and handle the situation in the great informative and the correct way it delivers some of the good impression with the others it delivers some of the good impression with the decision making authorities and the refractive thinking and makes some of the good impressions and the possible way of the work i approachesi feel very about the situation it delivers some of the bad impression with the other in the office , so i really bad about the situation it makes me some intense and delivers the some of the bad thinking of the other colleagues in the decision i handle the situation and makes me some of the feel of in the other colleaguesi very upset in this situation because of the timing of the travel will make many of the willing things and the important things to about the country it makes me some of the important about the country but the time i really miss the opportunity for it so it is very bad for me
since we cannot both agree i woould atrrange for another week that would be at inconvenience to me but it is for a longer strategy as fopr as my work goes tofro my furture benefit i would look grea tin eyes of mangementi would certainly do the project i would not mdottle with it but do as much as i can quickly i would keep in mind the boses' tendencies to sneak something onme at the last minute i wul f try to convince my colleugue to go with m , e i thinl it is important that one of us gp if he does not go , i will have t go for both oput befits anywayi would research the comments and look for a way to go over them wioth hiom with some ammuniton in hamd i would not allow it to detract froma future bonus i might even go over hos head if i thonk the commets are way off bnsei would love to learn more abot the cuklture of norway , i like learning about opther culters so this is a great way to do it i would also have a big in with the management as a voumteeer and do something that the company would reward me later for monetairly anyway
i would examine my vacation plans and see if i could change them if not , i would meet with my colleague alone and discuss the situation to see if we can figure out some compromise perhaps we could move the dates of our vacations a bit to reduce the overlap , or maybe my colleague is n't as firm on those dates as it appears after that i 'd request a meeting with my colleague and my supervisor to settle on a fair course of action that meets at least most of our goals this would be the fairest way to do it i would go ahead and get as much done on the project as possible , with a view to completing it before the deadline i have the time to do it now i would schedule some review time to take one more look at it before i submit it on the due date this would let me stay on path to get the project done , while making sure i have time to handle any last minute things that might come my way proper time management is the key to workplace peace i would try to persuade my colleague to go with me , even if just for a short time my thought being that once we 're there , it may be a good time and the colleague would want to stay longer in any case it 's important for us to make an appearance at the event to show our support for the client i 'd also point out that our bosses will probably be there and it would n't do to not be seen by them i would first go off myself and analyze what the feedback says , and if it truly reflects my performance at work did i understand it correctly \? i would ask one of my close colleagues to give me their input on the issue as well , and perhaps see if i could schedule a meeting with hr to discuss what options i have , since this feedback could have such a major effect on me i would also ask my manager how i can improve to avoid things like this in the future i would certainly volunteer for the project i have long been interested in the nordic countries and would love to learn more about norway especially if i was getting paid to do it i am good at learning new information quickly , and there is lots available about this country it would be an enjoyable diversion from my regular daily duties
i would go ahead and switch my vacation week personally that kind of stuff does not bother me however i would keep that in the back of my mind next time something comes around i would not fret about it much at all though i would tear into the project due in two weeks as quickly as possible knowing that my boss tends to give me last minute tasks , i would plan ahead of time and begin work on this project with my workload light from other stuff , i could prepare ahead of time and get the job done i would go because it is still a networking opportunity just because i do not know anyone there is not a reason not to go as i am confident of my abilities i would have not quams going at it alone i would be a little upset but not reveal it at work i would do my best to reevaluate the situation , see where the critique would be accurate , then develop a plan to adapt and adjust my work habits overall i would be disappointed but not angry i would find the experience enjoyable i like learning about other countries and cultures i do not mind travelling so even that would be fun for me expanding one 's horizons is never usually a bad thing
i would move my vacation if i had plans , i am certain they could be rearranged i would take full advantage of the brownie points i would earn for being willing to change my request i would want to jump in and get started on it right away i have learned that waiting can lead to rushed all nighters i would complete the project , and then take the extra time to polish it up , or refine it and take a break after it was done , unless i got one of those last minute projects my boss is famous for i would probably not go with my chronic fatigue , the long day at work was enough of a strain on me , and i do n't want to get so run down i get sick plus , i do n't do well around a lot of people , so a networking event would be incredibly taxing on me at the best of times i would ask to speak to my manager to get clarification on what the negative feedback was about , and ask if there was anything i could do to change the feedback i might also look into going to my supervisor 's supervisor to state my reasons for disagreeing with the feedback i would be thrilled to be chosen for the project my family is from norway , and it would be a wonderful fit for me i would find it a very enjoyable experience in addition , i like to learn about other cultures , so i would be a good fit for the project no matter what country the client was in
i would go ahead and let them take their 's first i take my vacations alone and i am very flexible this would not be a big deal to me i would go ahead and get this finishes as effeciently as i can while also making sure the work is done right that way when the boss drops that surprise work on me i can do it with no interruptions i would go ahead and go it makes me look really good to important people this could lead to more oppertunities for me and i could even make more friendsi would talk to my manager tell them my point of view and why i think they are wrong will still being courteous and professional i am positive i can sway their view i would find this very enjoyable the prospect of learning about a new culture and learning new things excites me plus i could use the aforementioned vacation time to go to norway and learn even more
it depends on who requested it first if it was me i would be vehement in going on my vacation and making my co worker stay behind if he went first , then i would probably concede since i view it as a first come first serve i would have do dedicate more time to finish the projects i have the type of personality where i do n't like to leave things unfinished it would probably be stressful but i'm sure i could handle it i would try to convince them that this is extremely important for our careers i would try to guilt trip them into going , or promise them that it would be worth their time i might even offer them a favor in return i would ask them why they decided to give me that feedback and if there was any way to make up for it if it was a genuine issue i would be calm about it but also firm at the same time i would n't accept it if it was n't legitimate i would probably find it enjoyable because i love to learn new things about countries it would be an experience for me that would broaden my knowledge it could also be useful to me in the future especially in my career
if i did not have a serious conflict and it was far enough ahead of the planned week , i would attempt to re schedule my vacation it is not so much for the colleague if they are so unwilling to change plans , but moreso to be responsible and make sure work gets covered and also i am a flexible person that easily adapts to change which often other people are not my decision might also depend on if i have already paid for a vacation and costs are non refundable or the supervisor 's demands are unreasonable i then might attempt to negotiate or refuse depending on the circumstances i would start the project and finish it as soon as possible that is my typical behavior anyways as i like to keep busy i know that unanticipated issues can come up and complicate plans so it is better to start earlier and be prepared ahead to ensure the final product is its best that depends if it is important that i personally be there because the client expects it and it will improve the company relationship , then i probably would go even if i was tired so long as i did n't have other commitments it is not important to me that i do n't know anyone else there , especially at a business engagement if it was more of a personal leisure event i might feel a little more uncomfortable i might also make some learn some new and important information and make valuable connections networking i would likely voice my objections if i truly believed they were wrong as i am a rather straight forward person , but do so in a calm and tactful manner i would give my reasons logically and likely present proof if it was more of a subjective judgment where evidence is not apparent , i might feel unmotivated , may feel it is not worth the effort \( or very little effort \) , and in such an environment i might feel unappreciated and if it could n't be resolved or improved i might choose to look elsewhere for a new place of employment i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i love learning , seeing , doing new things , whether it be related to general knowledge , different cultures , seeing new places , trying new foods so i would gladly volunteer to be involved i would likely be gaining new insights , meeting new people , and increasing my skills i would see this as a great opportunity
i would check when this colleague took his last two vacations if that was at the same time or so as mine or i rescheduled my vacation in the past because of this , would ask to reschedule it and pick up another time if he insists taking vacation anyway , i would escalate conflict and ask to intervene my manager to resolve this issue also i explain why to both of them why i do in this way i would prefer to finish the project earlier anyway because of my boss' nature , i will keep some time for this very last minute project i believe it wo n't give me any problems in the future because i prefer to finish my work in time or earlier anyway moreover , it will keep my busy and not being bored as welli 'll try to persuade to go there explaining this is very important for work relationship i would insist to accept this invitation if my colleague does n't want to go anyway , will try to get as much info as i can in this case , i would go by myself i 'll be very upset about it i would talk to my manager later about this situation i will try to figure out how he came to conclusion that was my mistake or so i would try to explain he was not right in his judgement if he still thinks he is right , i would n't feel any obligations and started to look around for another jobi would prefer to think carefully about it i would n't make this decision very soon volunteering is absolutely not mandatory and my decision depends on how i'm busy with my current projects right now if i'm not so busy , would like to agree
i would first ask my supervisor to ask co workers who would be willing to cover the shifts with possible overtime or shift change another option for the supervisor to consider would be to grant the vacation to the person with more seniority last option would be to determine who submitted their vacation first i would start the project immediately knowing that my boss tends to give last minute task i would also want to start as soon as possible to have time to properly put it together i would finally dedicate a certain time of day to work on the project for consistency i would still go i would not feel uncomfortable because i adapt very well in unfamiliar environments i would not feel out of place because the purpose of the meeting is to network i would request a meeting with the manager to go into more detail about why he came to this conclusion i would also advise the manager that i do not agree with the feedback and explain why i would expect the manager to also explain with tangible proof i would most likely volunteer for the project i enjoy meeting people and new learning about new cultures i would however feel slighted a bit about the norway experience because the benefit of actually traveling there would be extremely educational
i would talk to my managers again about the situation at hand my colleague and i are both giving adequate notice about our upcoming vacation plans it is the manager 's job to make sure there is adequate coverage it is not our responsibility to change our plans i would be able to handle this project because i am confident in my work ethic i am very good about keeping a control on time and finishing projects in a timely manner even if i needed to stay late once or twice to finish those projects , i am positive they would get done in time i would still go whether or not my colleague went with me it is a huge networking meeting , and even if i went and did not know anyone when i got there that is the whole point of the meeting to make new connections and business ventures i think it would turn out for the good to go even though it has been a long day i would ask my manager to show me some proof of the negative feedback they gave me i would also voice the importance of that want , and that i believe i am a good and valuable worker and deserve my annual bonus if they have proof to show me and back up their opinion then lets discuss further i would find this experience enjoyable i really like learning about different cultures , and even if i did not have to travel it would still be fun to learn all i can to help the new client feel really apart of the family
i would request my supervisor look up who requested the time off first i typically plan vacations well in advance and request time off accordingly this being said my vacations are usually planned and spent away from home and out of state i would also not be willing to change my plans and request y supervisor work it out i would put all my time and effort into this current project expecting my boss to assign other tasks over the next two weeks , i would ensure to be as efficient as possible i would also consult my boss if he foresees any projects coming up in those two weeks so i can plan accordingly i would go to the networking event this would be a great opportunity for me to get to know the clients first hand this would also give me the opportunity to become a familiar face with our client i would first take into consideration everything that was provided to me i would then research facts to counter the feedback that was given to me if it is available once doing the research , i would request another meeting to further discuss the feedback and address my stance i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about new countries and cultures it allows for further diversity , which is a great opportunity
i would change my vacation plans but tell my colleague that he owes me a favor i would start working on the project right away so as to get it out of the way i would work bit by bit every day i would pace myself so as to prevent having a lot to do at the end i would convince my colleague to go and tell them i owe them a favor i would tell them i 'd cover for them next time i would try to convince my manager that he is wrong i would feel angry but try to act calm i would argue my case step by step i would find this experience enjoyable i would experience new things which i usually do n't get to do i would immerse myself
i would change my vacation it would be better for me down the line i would make friends with the coworker and they would do it for me i would get it done as soon as possible i would do it to prepare in case he throws something at me i would get it done asap i would n't go if i was tired however , even ifi don''t know anyone i would still go if i was up to it it 's important to network and meet people i would talk to my manager i would want specifics to try to understand i would take time ot make my case i would find it very enjoyable i love experiencing new cultures i would also offer to travel
i would have to change my plans i would not be happy about it at all and im sure it would cause a rift between us but all in all , it would have to be me one way or another sadly i would work as hard and as fast to get the project done if my boss has a habit of dropping things last second , i would try and plan in advance to get the project completed as far as i could , to have wiggle room that more than likely is the only real planning i could do in advance in a case like thisi would sadly have to go the meeting cannot go without representation from the company im sure , and if he does not go it sounds like im the only other person capable so id go , but more than likely not happy about being put into a situation like thisi would be very upset and angry i would go to the manager and ask them to clarify the problems they stated if they couldnt do that , i would go over their heads to their manager and file a complaint about the abuse of power making false claimsi would actually love to do something like this eventhough it would take a lot of time and effort , i think something like this would be fun to do learning about new cultures and ways actually interests me so i would jump at this chance
if my vacation did n't involve travel or firm plans , i would probably change my vacation time unless we requested the time off at exactly the same moment though , whoever turned in the request first should get that time off while my work load is light , i would complete work that i had to do as quickly as possible i would also get as much of my project done as possible during this time when it came down to crunch time , i would juggle things as best i can , and stay late if need be to finish the project i would go i have no problem going to events where i do n't know anyone any chance to do networking , especially with a large client should never be passed up i would think about the situation carefully before making any decisions if my bonus was at stake , i would request a meeting with my manager and his her supervisor before the meeting i would have lined out my reasons for disputing the feedback i would love it ! i do n't know much about norway , and what a great opportunity to learn i'm fascinated by people from different countries and cultures and i leap at every chance i get to learn about something other than what i'm familiar with
i would like to know who has seniority in this instance and that is who should get the requested vacation time this should be a question for the supervisor and not for us to have to decide if the supervisor will not help , i will forgo my plans and schedule it at another time i would work on the project now since i have a light workload leading to the due date this would prepare me for any tasks given to me by the boss this would also assure that i have the project completed when due and have open availability for any unscheduled projects by the boss i would definitely go to the networking meeting this is one of the largest clients and should be given the respect of someone from our group being there there is no excuse for not knowing anyone there since i am an outgoing person and friendly i will have no trouble making friends with the people at the meeting in fact , they may remember me and personally invite me to their next meeting i would ask for a conference with the boss and whoever else gave the negative feedback i deserve to defend myself against the charges since i do n't feel they are true this could negatively affect my work record if i ever applied for another job it will also mean the loss of my yearly bonus i feel i will be exonerated once all the information is put on the table i would love the opportunity for this project i think it would be awesome to learn about norway and the cultures of the country this would be a highly interesting and enjoyable experience
i would choose a different date as i do n't have the tolerance to go back and forth with my colleague about this however going forward i would definitely keep this in mind , because i'm pretty sure a time will arise where the colleague will need my assistance of some sort a forgive but most definitely not forgetting situation i would go ahead and complete the project during this time this will allow me to have an open calendar should something else become available for me to complete it will also let my supervisor see just how responsible i am i would still go to the meeting it 's always good to have some new people within my circle who knows what this invite may lead to i would feel very disappointed about this i would take this opportunity to ask my manager to sit down with me so that i can explain my side this will also allow us to see things from each others point of view i would find this experience very enjoyable i would have the opportunity to be apart of a new project and also learn new things about norway with me being apart of this project who knows this could turn into something more meaningful for me
i would first ask if there was anyone available to replace me if not , then i would work that week i would choose to do that because i would at least want to know if the vacation was possible but would n't want to lose my job either i would ask my boss if i could talk privately and calmly explain that the project is very important to me and the company , and getting side tracked with last minute projects is overwhelming me i chose this because i want my boss to know i value my job but i am still human and get stressed i would hope that my boss understands that too many projects at once could overwhelm anybody i would understand how my colleague is feeling and tell them that i will be at the meeting if they change their mind i chose this because i would n't want to miss out on meeting new people i also did n't want my colleague to feel pressured and want them to know that i am a trustworthy person they could talk to if they feel nervous i would try to calmly ask the manager what they think i should do to get better at my work , be it more training , interpersonal skills or what ever it is that i am getting negative feedback on i would also let them know that i do not agree with their feedback but to keep my job i would make some changes with my work ethic with whatever advice they give me i would think that not traveling to norway and just researching it would be boring i would rather travel there and get to know it personally , meet the people there and learn the history from others' words rather than a book or the internet i would still research on the internet but as a social person , i learn more from trying new things and talking to others
i would leave the decision up to the supervisor , because i will not change my vacation day just for a colleague colleague does n't constitute my boss and their needs do n't trump mine in any way whatsoever so let the boss break the bad news to one of us , i'm not going to back down i would ask my boss which tasks i should prioritize and which task is more important to get done and be honest if the boss knows i ca n't do everything all at once , then he might be willing to find someone else who can lighten the workload so my work is accurate , and i can actually do my job i would go without my colleague , there 's no need to know anyone there if it 's a networking meeting the whole point is to go and get to know people there i'm not going to be scared to do something alone i would find a way to speak to hr and find a lawyer immediately , i'm in no position to lose my job over bogus feedback i would find it enjoyable because i 've always enjoyed learning about other cultures , the fact that there is no travel needed is perfect because i would n't have to leave my home and my family behind
i would most likely change my plans if that were possible to make it easier on the rest of my colleagues if i could n't easily change my plans either , i 'd suggest some sort of selection game or process such as picking a number or doing rock , paper , scissors to figure out which one of us should get that week of vacation i would do as much work on the project i can now so that i 'd be prepared if extra work would be assigned last minute by doing the work when my workload is lighter i 'll have a better chance at getting it all finished i might even get it done ahead of time and have extra time to look over it and be free in case of last minute changes to my workload or schedule i would go ahead and go while it would be nice to know someone there , it is about networking and meeting new people so , even if my colleague does n't want to go , i 'd go in order to look good for the client and to make new contacts that might be helpful or useful in the future i would be very upset and hurt and angry i 'd most likely look back over the feedback and the project or period that it applied to and find support for my feelings and proof of where i thought the negative feedback was wrong then i 'd schedule a meeting with my manager and ask them to go over the material with me to see if we could revise the evaluation i would find it interesting i 'd be curious and find it interesting to learn about a new culture and find out what norway was all about i like to learn and finding out new things would be entertaining for me
i would ask myself if it 's something that would be easy for me to change if i had n't made any concrete plans \( bought tickets , reservations the cannot be cancelled etc \) i would bring in this evidence to show my supervisor it really also depends on who requested the week off first did we both know about this policy beforehand \? was both our vacations approved and then retroactively they decided we both could n't take the same week off \? if nothing else i would try to have a private conversation with my coworker about who has more at stake if they cancelled plans there are so many other facets to this question that would need to be explored i would do my best to have a concrete outline of my plan to finish the project i would figure out how much time or how many tasks would need to be completed each day to hit the goal of finishing the project on time as with any kind of planning , there is allotment for interruption or setbacks and i would do my best to implement those if my workload continued to be light then the worst outcome is the project would be completed early and i would have more time to finalize and perfect the finished product , or begin on new projects it really would depend on how i was feeling mentally and physically if it would not be too draining for me and i felt it would help my career , i would probably go it sounds like a nice time to have after work and an opportunity to network with an important client i think i would try to keep it as short and concise as i could , though , based on the fact that i might not know anyone there other than the client i'm probably already working full time and time spent away from work is just as important it would simply depend on my mood if it is a facet of my job that i take the most pride in , or that i really focus and strive towards on a daily basis , i would definitely be having a meeting to discuss i would gather up my evidence of my hard work and dedication to whatever the issue is and present it in a way that i feel it is being undervalued i am always open to criticism , however , and after my presentation and opportunity to share is over i would like to hear ways they could help me improve based on what they heard it always helps to improve but i will not take it laying down if i feel my integrity is at stake if there wo n't be travel involved , then i do n't see a lot of opportunity to use my knowledge or apply it if i am being asked to apply my knowledge in design , or if i will be travelling , then i would go above and beyond to learn i always love learning about new cultures and languages but i would need that extra incentive also , how many projects am i already working on \? i would n't want to take on more work for no travel and spread myself thin
i would not like it , but i would let them have it i would just do it with the condition that next time , i get first choice i do n't think it is worth fighting over i would be sure to stay on top of my tasks as the project progressed this would keep me from being too overwhelmed if my boss gave me last minute tasks i was n't expecting if the tasks assigned by my boss were too unreasonable for the time allowed to complete them , i might even express that to my boss i would go ahead and go anyway so that i could network with important people even though i would have to go alone , it might be an important experience that i should n't meet i would make the best of it i would take some time to consider the reasons behind the review after taking that time , i would have a conversation with my boss and explain why i disagreed with the feedback i would be uncomfortable in this role , but it would be necessary i would love to have this type of opportunity ! i think it would be a great experience and i would volunteer to do it ! it could provide even better opportunities later
i would first see how important this vacation date is to me if it is not that important , then i would happily just choose another date however , if the date is important to me , then i would tell the supervisor to decide himself because i cannot change dates i would try to finish the project as early as possible generally , i like finishing things early so that i can thoroughly review them also if my boss gives me extra work at the last minute , it would not be a problem i would try really hard to convince them to go however , if they decide not to go , i would go by myself and just get out of my comfort zone it is a networking meeting so the whole point would be to connect with new people i would have a meeting with my manager and state my case on how his feedback is wrong if we can come to an agreement after the meeting then that would be great however , if there is no agreement then i would have to reconsider my position at that job i would find that experience very interesting i like learning about different countries and cultures , so it would be fun for me plus i might make some norwegian friends !
i would get over it and move on with life let the baby have their bottle life is short , why worry i would pray for patience and to be able to complete anything needed i have all the time in the world i can do anything i need to i would go and make new friends i'm not shy and it 's great to meet new people the more friends the merrier i say ! i feel like the person is mistaken i would talk to them privately i would explain how they are mistaken and that i'm an alright guy i would find it enjoyable because it 's fun to learn new things you never know when it 'll come in handy maybe i 'll be on jeopardy and the final question is about norway
i would try to determine which of us it would be easier to switch our weeks do either the other person or myself have reservations that cannot be changed \? if the other person did not , and my plans could be changed , i would speak to my supervisor and possibly change i would find out who requested the week off first i would find out both sides of the story who all would be effected by these changes \? find out from the supervisor why it is necessary for one person to change where these dates ok 's per the supervisor , and she made a mistake \? i would go ahead and try and get my project done now given the history of my boss assigning last minute task , i do not want to feel overwhelmed and stressed over trying to get more done the next few weeks are light , but if my boss assigns extra work it will be a time issue if my boss does not give extra work , then the rest of few weeks will be a breeze i would go anyway i have never let anyone else hold me back , just because they cancel if i go , this could open up other opportunities for me i would go speak with my boss this makes me feel inadequate at my job , and i would like to try and get it resolved speaking to my boss , may change the whole situation and make things right again i would find this project enjoyable i enjoy learning about other cultures and countries although the boss said that this may not require travel , it may require travel and that would be a fantastic trip
i would try to move my vacation if possible if my vacation could not be moved , because relatives or friends were attending , or i could not get a refund on reservations , i would try to convince my colleague to change maybe i could offer them a favor in return i would approach my boss and ask if there was any work in the pipeline that he was planning on delegating to me if so , i would try to arrange my schedule , work overtime , etc to accommodate all my assignments i would do my best to meet the deadline i would probably bow out as well i would be tired and not feel up to it more importantly , i am shy by nature and would not want to go i would feel angry and hurt after the initial adrenaline faded , i would try to figure out what i could do to salvage my reputation and bonus i would definitely not trust my manager to have my back in the future i would find this experience enjoyable my ancestors are from norway and sweden , and so studying the culture and country would be fascinating for me i would not think it boring
i would probably give in to his request i do n't take many vacations when i do vacation its usually to work on my home or just to rewind i do n't travel much i would try getting an early start on it most likely there would be something come up to interfere with it i 've always liked getting my stuff done as soon as possible just for that reason i would go to the meeting there are things that can advance your career and things that can put you behind others it 's always useful to get to now the big clients i would ask where he got his information if it is hearsay i 'd ask where it came from if he did n't want to give me the answer i 'd bring it to human resources i would find it enjoyable the part about not traveling helps make the decision easier there are also benefits to learning about another culture and people
i would be willing to change my plans if i had not booked anything in advance i would make sure that my colleague knows that i had sacrificed this time for him her i would let the supervisor know that i had done the other colleague a favor i would make sure to tackle this project as soon as i get the chance whenever i have a free chance to work on this project , i will work on it so that i will not be overwhelmed when anything last minute comes up i would make sure that i finishe way in advance so that i can check it over and make sure it s complete by the due date i would suck it up and go to the networking event i would think that it would be better for my career prospects later on i would have to sacrifice immediate gratification for long term gain i would try to convince my colleague to go along as well i would request a time to meet with my manager to discuss the feedback i would tell the manager my point of view and also listen to the reasoning on why i was given a low score i would provide evidence and proof as to why my feedback should not be as low as i was given i would try to win back the favor of the manager i think it would be enjoyable to learn about a new country and culture it would be a great opportunity to go outside my bubble and learn something new it would allow me to be a bit more learned and gain new experiences in life it would be a great adventure
i would move around my plans there is not much that ca n't be put off until the next week i would make sure that i left my stuff done for my vacation week i would make sure that all of the project is done quickly then going up to the due date i can tweek anything that needs to be attended to i would make sure that everything was on time dispite delays i would try to talk them into going if the do not i would make sure that i had my ideas ready unknown people are just new reasons to network i would feel very upset i would try to take a few minutes to get my mind straight and i would type everything that i need to be thinking about i would get my thoughts straight over the next few days and possibly readdress the issue at another time i think that would be enjoyable learning new things and getting new ideas would be fun i think the accents of the new client and the demographic information would be enriching
i would ask my colleague why they need this vacation week so badly , and hear them out if their reasoning was good enough , such as plane tickets on that date , i would n't argue for it if i had a better reason , however , i would try to convince them otherwise i would begin working on the project in small chunks , so that when if my boss gives me another task , i will not be so offput by it i would make sure to complete at least half of it by a week this will give me more felxibility i would most likely end up going regardless it is a valuable networking opportunity , and even without my colleague i will gain valuable opportunities i would try to see if they can come , but if not then i 'll go anyways i would ask if i can have a discussion with my manager about the incident i would ask if there was any way that i can make up for it i would definitely just discuss the matter in an honest way i would probably find it boring i would n't want to dedicate my time to a culture that i do n't care too much about it would n't be worth my time
i would let the co worker take the week off if they requested the time prior to me if so , i would chose a different week to go if the co worker requested the time off after me , i would speak with the manager saying that it is only fair that i get the time since i requested it first even though the due date is two weeks away , i would work to complete the project as soon as possible this way , if something came up , i would n't have to push to get the original project done it would be less stress to get it done and out of the way prior to anything big coming in i would take the opportunity to go to the networking event even if i do n't know anyone , i can always make small talk and work to network with someone that have the same interests the whole point of networking is to meet new people and that i what i would try to do i would feel upset regarding the situation i would find a way to provide the negative feedback wrong in most cases , we have access to performance data that might be able to counteract what the manager is saying if that did n't work , i would request a meeting with my manager and their manager i would find the situation boring it would be information that might be useless since i would have to travel to the location i could be spending my time working on something more valuable
i would be willing to deal with my co worker , with the understanding that they would owe me a favor that 's far more useful than having an angry co worker , and i get to take the vacation anyway i would try to cancel my plans to minimize loss of money i would try to get the project done early this allows me to make minor tweaks leading up to since my schedule is light , i have the time to do it now , and it gives me time to complete my bosses' tasks as they come up i would go you can always meet new people , and you never know who might turn up at an event like this i would try to convince my co worker to go , however , if they were n't dead set on not going i would feel really personally attacked i would ask my other management team for feedback , or possibly upper levels of administration i would also schedule time with my manager to discuss how they hope i address the feedback i would love to learn more about culture ! i have an anthropology degree , so learning about culture is what i do it would be a valuable experience to grow as a person without having to travel internationally
i would assess my vacation plans and see if they are able to be changed if not , i would request that the supervisor select who would receive the vacation if they are unable to , i would suggest that we randomly pick the name of the person who should receive it i would outline everything that needs to be done for the project then , i would set reasonable goals , so i'm not rushing to complete the project last minute i would want to have some extra time before the due date , just in case i would still go to the meeting , because it could be great to meet some new contacts i do n't think it 's good to let someone else get in the way of positive opportunities you never know who you will meet , and what it could lead to i would set a meeting to discuss the issue further i would summarize the situation and facts and email everything to the manager , with ccing hr hopefully discussing the details would resolve the issue and i would receive no consequences i would find the experience enjoyable i'm always interested in learning about new cultures and new people also , maybe it would lead to travel to norway in the future
i would not change my vacation plans workers are entitled to go on vacation when they want to plus , my plans would likely already be cemented and i would n't change that because of a pushy supervisor i would begin working on the task in small increments , a few minutes here and there i would build up to the bigger parts of the project therefore , i would n't have to do it all at once and i could plan along the way i would not go to the meeting i'm very shy and would hate to go not knowing anyone , even if it would be good for me in the long run i would just hope that i do n't miss out on an important opportunity i would go to my manager and talk to them about how i feel hopefully , we could come to a common understanding i would not want negative feedback that is n't true to get in the way of my career it would be difficult to stand up for myself but i would have no choice i would love this experience it would mean getting the chance to learn about another culture and then implement it in the real world i also enjoy learning facts
i would stand my ground and let the supervisor decide who should stay to work for the week i would n't attempt to talk the colleague into working the week i would compromise if any incentive to work in the week was given i would start immediately in working on the project knowing there could be extra time needed for other work i would create a schedule to finish the project with time to spare for the other work i would communicate with my boss to know if time was needed for other work i would try to talk my colleague into going , and if they wont , i would go alone i would connect with the client by explaining our relationship with the colleague that knows the client i would try to network at the meeting without trying to feel out of place i would set up a meeting with the boss to explain why i feel the feedback is not true i would politely explain my case and be open to work on things that i am doing wrong i would find this experience enjoyable as i think it is interesting in learning and understanding the customs of another culture i would want to travel and be fully immersed in the culture for the purposes of the project
i would change my vacation i wanted to have more time to plan a better trip i would begin to take my work home with me every night i would work on the projects for an extra hour even though i did not get paid i would really want to get the job done in time ask her why she did wan to go to the networking meeting try to convince her to with me tonight i f i cannot persuade i would ask someone else or go alone i would discuss the situation with my manager i would ask my manager what i can do to improve so i will not lose my annual bonus and not to take the situation too personal i would find the job very interesting because i enjoy learning about new cultures as well as doing research i would find volunteering for this job enjoyable
i would change my vacation instead because i do n't want any drama if i had preplanned a vacation with other people then i would probably try to come to a compromised with my coworker hopefully they would n't be jerk about it and reschedule i would try to avoid my boss i would be available but unavailable at the same time i would try to convey that i am more busy than i'm actually i'm , so they could find someone else to bother i would pretend to be sick or have an emergency if that fails , i would pressure my colleague into going with me i would tell them if they do n't go , they might be putting our company in jeopardy , because if i do n't make a good impression because i am uncomfortable then they maybe liable i would probably quit before i am fired i do n't wont a mark on my record so i would rather leave i do n't need the negativity i would find it a bit overwhelming because if it 's not a country that i am interesting in , then it may be a bit of a challenge and norway seems like a country i would n't be interested the good thing about it is , i do n't have to travel so a good google search should suffice
i would think about what i was planning to use my vacation time for if it was something that could be easily rearranged \( for example , a staycation or something i did n't have reservations for \) , i would offer to pick another week if i needed it to be that week , i would try to explain the situation to my supervisor to try to get to keep the week i would look at my project and break it down into several small parts which i would then plan to do over the course of the next week i would try to space these parts out enough so that if i was given a last minute task , i would have enough time to do the task and to finish the project on time i would do this because it 's a time management strategy that has worked well for me in the past and it tends to decrease stress as deadlines loom i would ask the colleague to come with me at least for the first half hour or so i would do this because i would want to have some personal support at the networking event , and because i think this would be the most fair to both me and my colleague i would feel an obligation to go for a little while to the meeting even if my colleague refused because it seems like this meeting is important to my standing at my job i would feel frustrated about this situation , and i think i would feel pretty stressed out about it i would try to sit on it for a day or two to calm down , and then i would ask my manager if we could discuss the feedback and whether there was anything i could do to try to even out the situation such as additional training or redoing a project , and i would hope that these efforts would result in me still receiving my annual bonus , etc i would find this experience very enjoyable i enjoy learning about new things , and i'm especially interested in new cultures i also find norway and the surrounding region to be fascinating and i 've read many books about set in this locale , so i think i would be well suited to the task , and thus it would be enjoyable and fulfilling
it depends on who requested the vacation during that time first or if travel arrangements have already been made if i had already requested and arranged for it , i would put my foot down and tell the supervisor i asked for it first so should have priority if not , i might be willing to accommodate their travel plans and simply schedule mine for a week before or a week after i would definitely try to work ahead of time to make sure that it is mostly done well ahead of the due date that way if there are any last tasks i can devote all of my attention at the end towards that instead of catching up on what is expected i would do that just to make sure to avoid any stress that may result from the additional work and be able to handle it it 's always good to plan ahead , especially if i know the boss usually does that i would try to talk them into going because it would be more comfortable for me if they were there i 'd probably offer to buy them dinner or drinks afterwards or return the favor somehow if they insisted on really really not wanting to go , i would accept that and suck it up and go to the meeting without them i would feel very apprehensive and a bit upset if it was n't true i 'd politely give them an argument as to why i feel like they are incorrect i 'd give them facts and suggest someone that can maybe back me up about the situation who was witness to the contrary , if applicable i would find it very enjoyable for sure i do n't know anything really about norway or their history and culture and i like learning new things i would like to travel , honestly , but honestly would find it fascinating just to learn about a culture that is different than mine and work with someone from another country
i would take to the person and see if we can come to an agreement i think that whoever asked for time off first should be able to get that week if they are able to agree to that than i think it can be handled with little issue since i dont have a lot to due leading up to the deadline i would work hard on it now that makes sense because i should n't wait until more stuff piles up on my plate also since my boss gives last minute task there is a possibility that i might not have time in the future i would still go to the meeting i think it is important to stay on this clients good side also it would be a chance to meet new people to work with i would not feel good about the situation if it can affect my chance of a bonus i would try to talk to my boss and tell him my position on the subject i would also make an effort to improve myself so that they see i am trying hard i would find the enjoyable i think learning about new cultures so this would not seem like a burden to me if i could travel to the country that would be a bonus because i like to travel
i would request that the person who requested the vacation first be allowed to take vacation i would discuss with the coworker to determine whose vacation is easier to cancel ideally if the the other person 's vacation is movable , i could take mine as scheduled i would start on the project immediately i would n't waste time i would n't want to delay and let other things pile up i would not go i know i would be more successful if i had a buddy at such an event i would look for a new event for both of us i would politely ask if we can talk about the details i would present my side calmly i would make sure i was n't making excuses , but just carefully explaining i would find it very interesting i would love to learn new things about new places i do n't mind not traveling either
i would change my vacation plans unless there was some serious reason that my plans could n't be changed the only reasons i would not agree to change my plans would be if i had planned to attend an 'event' \( for example a wedding \) that could n't be changed , or if i had made reservations with non refundable tickets , or if i would really inconvenience other people that i was planning the vacation with i want to be flexible and get along with other people at work it does n't matter if the other employee is being selfish or unreasonable it might lower my opinion of them that they are acting this way , but i do n't mind having the other employee 'get their way' i would do my best to get the project done ahead of time i have a tendency to procrastinate so it would take some will power to work on the project early and get it done well before the due date but since the boss could spring something else on me at any time , like the last minute , i should feel the 'fear' that it could happen and then i would n't be able to finish the initial project in time since my job could be in jeopardy if i do n't work on the project in advance , i would just go ahead and try to finish it and get it off my mind i would definitely go to the networking meeting , especially since it 's with one of my largest clients if my colleague does n't go that is actually probably good for me i do n't need to network with my colleague i need to meet and network with people i do n't know yet there is no way to know what i might miss or who i might miss meeting if i do n't go even if i'm tired , i can show up and be nice and talk to people it is much more likely to be good for my career if i go than if i do not go i would talk to my manager and try to get some clarification on what i had done wrong even if i do n't agree with the feedback , if that 's what the manager thinks then i need to try to correct the situation there is always room for improvement , no matter how great a job i 'think' i am doing when i meet with the manager i would assure them that i will work hard to overcome any deficiencies they have seen in my work i want to do my best to be an excellent employee i would find the experience of learning about norway and norway 's culture enjoyable in my life i have worked at institutions that have attracted workers from all over the world i am so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet these people and get to know them it has been so interesting learning about the lives of these wonderful people i did work with one person from norway for a short time he was so enamored with the united states and loved the us so much that it was hard to get him to talk about norway i did learn that cross country skiing is a way of life there , and they are very proud of their olympic ski teams but i would love to learn more , especially if i would also be helping the company i work for by doing so
i would try to talk to my colleague then i would talk to my boss my last resort would be hr i would build a schedule that gets it done early i would make sure i have some wiggle room just in case i would be on guard i would go by myself i do well in situations like that i would be able to make new friends i would try to talk to him first if that did n't work i would talk to his boss if that 's possible finally i would go to hr and file a complainti would pass on the project something like that would take a lot of my personal time i just do n't have enough to spare
i would change my plans if they were changeable regardless , i would talk to my supervisor if i agreed to change my p lans , i 'd want first dibs next time around or request preference for time around the holidays if i ca n't change my plans , then i would discuss that i would start working on the project right away spend an amount of time each day to work on it if something urgent comes up , then i would let my supervisor know wher e i am at with the project but really , two weeks and a light workload gives me no excuse not to complete the project it 's better to say nothing and work late i would go , provided i am not too tired if i have enough energy to meet people and represent my company , i should go , especially if no one else from my company or department will be there the benefits would outweigh the negative , and if i am nervous in that situation it would be a good exercise for me i would submit a written response to the review and submit a copy to hr , and possibly next higher up i would request a meeting to discuss the concerns , expectations , and my concerns about raises , bonus , etc i would find the experience very enjoyable i would be learning about a culture and new business practices i would be expanding my knowledge base and hopefully open myself to new opportunities within the company and i would hope for the opportunity to travel
i would talk to my supervisor about who requested it first and believe that should be the person who is granted the time if requested on the same day \( unlikely \) then i would request that both of us plead our case to our supervisor and have them make the decision maybe one of us has airlines booked or something else that cannot be changed or a really important event that cannot be missed this should take priority over just a preference of a certain week i would complete the task ahead of schedule and prepare myself for any last minute tasks i would follow up with my boss ahead of the deadline and ask if they have anything else they would like done if it still happens at the last minute i would request an extension to the deadline to complete the work i would attend the meeting anyways i would take the opportunity to meet and talk with our client and possibly entrench my standing with them as the go to guy i would allow myself to have fun and use the opportunity to expand my standing with the client i would gather the facts related to the feedback and ask to meet with my boss again i would present my case and ask them to reconsider based on the information i provide if i am not happy with the outcome still , i will speak with their supervisor i would find this experience enjoyable i like to find out about other cultures and other people and i think this knowledge would help me be the point man for the project as i could relate to the client on a personal note , norway and its people fascinate me and i want to learn more about them
i would first talk to the colleague and ask them why i should be expected to change my vacation plans if they are unwilling to i would n't back down , but if they were not willing to agree , i 'd explain the situation to the manager and let him decide i believe whoever requested vacation for that week first should be the one who gets it the question seems to make it sound like i asked for it first , but either way , i would find that decision to be the fair one i would start working on the project early if i'm already at work , i prefer to be as productive as possible it actually makes the time go by quicker than just sitting around because it 's possible my boss would give me last minute tasks , i need to be prepared for that possible , so i should n't procrastinate on this important project i would n't go either first of all , i guess i'm not a highly ambitious career oriented person , even though earning opportunities for success is always a good thing but i think i 'd be anxious , nervous , and stressed out if i did n't know anyone at the meeting this might cause me to make a bad impression , which would do more harm than good i would feel very upset and wronged , and it 'd make me lose some respect for my manager i 'd approach my manager and ask if there was a time we could speak privately about the feedback i would try to calmly explain my perspective as to why i believed the feedback to be untrue , making sure to be respectful then i 'd just have to hope he saw where i was coming from and we came to some kind of understanding i would find the experience relatively enjoyable and interesting i like learning about new things , and norway and that whole area of europe is actually a place i'm curious about because i think in a lot of ways those countries are better than the u s \( higher standard of living , less violence \) i 'd be very willing to volunteer for the project
i do not like changing my vacation plans here i do not see much choice , however so i would bite the bullet to avoid being seen as a troublemaker i think it would be important to avoid my boss heaping on any last minute tasks i think i should appear to be busy that might discourage my boss ! i would think that my going is important to our boss in spite of my co worker not being there , i thin k i need to go i think it would be unpleasant , but much of work is , anyway i know people say you can appeal bad feedback my experience has not borne this out , however though i feel angry , i would try to suck up to my boss and given them what they want in the future i ca n't image that learning about norway would be fun in any sense in fact , it would be boring like being sent back to geography class \( now , i would find travel to norway to be a lot of fun , but that is not on offer here \)
i would not budge and attempt to get my requested vacation i would state that i have already made the plans and cannot change them , and explain why i deserve that week of instead of the other person if i performed better than them , i would definitely bring that up to further plead my case if the employer wo n't budge , i 'd offer to work remotely from the location a few days if the other person would agree to do the other days i would handle this project by getting the stuff done as soon as possible , prior to the due date in case my boss gives me any last minute tasks i 'd be prepared for the worst and get the small tasks done quickly in order to get feedback at an earlier date than the due date i may be confident in the project , but i need to be prepared to handle any last minute situations and tasks that may come my way i would handle it this way , because it is always best to get things done well and in time , than rush at the last minute i would go to the networking meeting even though my colleague is not going it would help me get ahead of my colleague and give me opportunities to meet and connect with people in the industry in addition , it would further my relationship with one of our largest clients , and give them a great impression of myself in comparison to my colleague all in all , i 'd go because it would be a great opportunity for me to further my career i would confront my manager about the feedback and explain my side of the story this situation would make me feel frustrated losing my annual bonus is not something i 'd want , so i 'd go to him and provide him with my reasonings as to why i do n't agree and what i will do to improve in addition , i would take the feedback and better myself in the months to come , while at the same time ensuring i get my bonus i would find this experience enjoyable i have always liked learning about new cultures and customs , so it would be an enjoyable project for me it would also further my relationship with our clients and show them that i am willing to go above and beyond to grow our relationship since i do n't have to travel , it would only add a few more hours to my workload and would only benefit myself and the company
i would make sure what was fair was carried out i really want vacation this week so who put in the request first should get to go i would keep a steady pace i would take on new tasks from my boss if they came up but only if i thought i could handle them i would not slack off so that i could handle these extra requestsi would still go after all it is an opportunity to meet new people it would be a test of confidence andi 'dbeproudof myself for going through it i would want to correct the situation this is not fair i would try to think objectively and without too much emotion i 'd bring up my case i think i would find this boring it would be difficult to communicate it seemes like it would be a lot of extra work
i would see how badly i needed that particular week and change if possible if not i would go to my boss and appeal since time off is important i would work as hard as i could to finish the project early that way if i got last minute work i would have the time and if not i could review the project detailsi would not go if they do n't go i do n't like to not know anyone and would feel awkward i would try to get my colleague to go thought i would talk first to my manager and , depending on the response , to a higher up i would make sure that my viewpoint was well known i would find it boring if travel was involved i would be inclined to do it otherwise it seems like a waste of time
i would attempt to work out a deal with my colleague for splitting the vacation time of that week i understand that both of us would want to have that time off , but it would only be fair if a compromise could be met if the other employee was insistent on not changing their vacation and we both had a equal standing seniority or first come first serve wise , i would then push to get it for myself based on my value to the business either way , my colleague would understand either to compromise or risk losing entirely i would do my best to get ahead on this project over the first portion of these 2 weeks that way i would be ready for whatever my boss had in store for me before my deadline this would allow me to complete my work early but also be ready for unexpected work without causing too much stress in my work life i would still go to the networking meeting because of the importance of being seen at such a meeting and of talking with the client i understand it may be at the end of a tiring day but i think it would be more important to go to the meeting than to unwind and relax the outcome of this meeting could be far reaching in comparison to relaxing after work for the future of my career i would try to get out of the situation so i would have a chance to cool off and think of my options after having some time to think about how to handle the situation i would talk to my manager about how i would be able to change the issues they have with my performance by doing this i would hope that i can show them my commitment to bettering my performance and abilities to do better in my work and be more valuable to the organization i would find this very enjoyable as i have long been fascinated with the culture and natural beauty of norway and scandinavia in general some of my favorite authors and tv shows are norwegian and i am fascinated by the landscape some of the natural beauty of norway is unmatched anywhere else in the world they are a very forward thinking people and are attempting to find solutions to problems in society in a rational way
i would try to dear with my colleagues in ordet to solve the issue withou involve our boss if hi 's not agree , i would ask to my boss take place on this situation because i scheduled my vacations first than my colleague i would ask my boss for more time in order to solve the delate also , i would explain to him that the due is because he gave us an unrealistic time for finishing this projecti would ask to my colleague the reason why he can not go to this meeting however , due to it is aour largest client , i would dicede to go to the meeting well , for sure i desagree with my boss the first thing i will do is asking him for an explanation about this negative feeback other thig i will do is asking him what should i do for solve it i would find this experience as an profesional opportunity to improving myslef for sure i would acept this oportunity
i would be considerate and let my coworker take a vacation during that time i will take my vacation the following week i feel that if the same situation were to happen again , they will return the favor for me and let me have the week off i would complete as much of the project as i could well before the due date since my boss is likely to give me additional work , i do n't want to have several extremely busy work days i would rather distribute all of the work across the 2 weeks to minimize stress i would likely not go to the networking meeting without my colleague i get really nervous in social situations , especially when i do n't know anyone i would rather go with a colleague than alone to help me break the ice with our clients i would schedule a meeting with my boss to discuss the feedback i would want to understand why my boss gave me negative feedback and try to convince him that it 's not true i would discuss my hard work and work ethic and state that the negative feedback is n't reflective of me i would enjoy learning about norway and their culture i think it 's fascinating to learn history and customs from other countries it really enriches your life it helps you better understand people and where they come from , not everyone has the same upbringing
i would work that week my colleague may be on vacation , but i will be making all the money that they will be missing i believe that bosses look at more flexible employees for promotions and that is just one more thing that works in my favor i would begin on the project as soon as possible i would much rather have things done ahead of time i would do this so i could be ready for any possible situation my boss could give me at the last minute i would go to the networking meeting opportunities could present themselves and i would n't want to miss out on anything short term discomfort is a small price to pay for long term success i would take the feedback in stride even if i do n't believe something is true , when it carries real consequences for me , i treat it very seriously feedback should always be taken as a way to improve i would find the experience to be extremely enjoyable i love learning new things i live my life by a way of thinking that you can always learn something new
i would tell my co worker that for this year i am willing to change my plans but for the holidays of the new period it is he who makes the sacrifice to modify his plans as i realizedi would think that my work load that feels light would take her calmly so that my boss does not find out and in that way i do not get fed up with more work since it could be harmful at the time of the presentation of the project i would look for all the ways of being able to participate in the network of the work group because for me it is extremely important to attend the vip clienti would speak with my human resources managers and line manager to discuss with my immediate boss about the negative evaluation because i try hard to do a great job and in this way be worthy of all my bonusesi would be willing to lead the new project because i am always interested in having new knowledge about new territories and that way when i travel i can talk to local people with greater property and understanding
i would be the bigger person and take a different week for my vacation it sounds like my colleague , for whatever reason , ca n't change their vacation , so i would let them have the week off i'm a pretty flexible person , and unless i had nonrefundable tickets to something , i would n't really care what week i had off in general , i ca n't afford to take a vacation where i 'd be going anywhere on a trip by plane , so i could probably take my vacation anytime i would make sure i was keeping on top of the project just in case my boss gave me last minute tasks that way , i would only have the last minute tasks to take care of , as every other part of the project would already be done i would also be sure not to make any other plans right before the project deadline in case i got stuck at work to finish the project i would stay organized and well prepared i would not go if my colleague did n't go i do n't like socializing in general , and definitely not if i do n't know anyone else there i would come up with some excuse as to why i could n't attend i also do n't think it 's fair to expect someone to go to a last minute evening event after a long work day i would feel as though i had been treated unfairly i would try my hardest to present my case without looking like i was just making excuses or trying to lay the blame elsewhere if my manager knows me well , and knows my history with the company , they should be able to see that what 's been said about me is n't true and give me the benefit of the doubt i would make sure to let my supervisor know that they had nothing to worry about , that i was more than committed to doing my best and that i would never do what i had been accused of , now , or in the future i would find this extremely enjoyable i 've always had an interest in scandinavian countries and would love to learn more about norway i would also like to learn a few phrases in norwegian i think it would be fun to speak with the new client in their language it would be really fun to learn a new culture
i would change my plans just to have a good image and show i can be nice i do n't mind changing my plans since i always do it maybe i would ask for a vacation the week after i would start the project as soon as possible to get it out of the way i do n't like to procrastinate because i feel pressured at the end i want to be as precise as i can be i would go just because its work related i feel i would have been missing out on something very important i would also try to convince him to go so he can be social and learn from it i would just take it and try to improve by my actions even if i disagree i ca n't do much about it since that 's his belief i would just improve my work and let it do the talking i would not take this only because it takes way too much effort learning a whole new culture seems like a hassle i would rather travel and learn the culture as i arrive
i would talk to my colleague to see what their vacation plans were if my colleague had already booked their vacation , then i would accept taking my vacation another time i would however , also request that the following year i am able to request my vacation first , since i had changed my plans on the other hand , if i had already booked my own vacation , i would ask my supervisor to look at seniority or who requested the vacation time first , so that the decision about who could go on vacation at what time could be made fairly i would likely at least start the project since i do not have a lot of work at the time i would likely not finish the project right away , but at least start it , making a plan of what to do for the project each day this way if something came up later , i would not have the entire project left to do , and i would n't be rushed to complete it , but would still have time to work on last minutes tasks i would still go to the meeting the client is important and so it would be important for the company to be represented at the networking meeting even though i would not know anyone else there if my colleague did n't go , i would still go , and i would try to convince my colleague to go too i would tell my colleague that the client is important and stress how important it was to make sure the company was represented and how if we did n't go , the client might do less business with us and that could negatively affect our jobs , so we should go to the meeting i would thank my manager for the feedback and then counter each point i disagreed with i would counter the points i disagreed with evidence for example , if my manager gave negative feedback regarding my timeliness , i would show how often i was on time to work , or how often i turn in projects in time or early , and ask if there is a specific incidence they are referring to so that i could address that incidence specifically i would find the experience enjoyable i would prefer if there were some trips to norway , but regardless of needing to travel to norway , i would still enjoy getting to know the norwegian client and learning more about their culture norway has a long history and there is a lot to learn about their country and culture and there would be a good opportunity to learn about them from a norwegian , or at least get their perspective about what i learned from other sources
i would make a decision based off of what i have planned for my vacation if i'm going on a trip i ca n't cancel , if i'm just staying home i would reschedule it i would get the work done now that way when my boss makes adjustments to the project i only have the add some things i wo n't have to rush through the work as much i would go to the event anyways the idea is to meet people at networking events so nobody i know being there is fine i could meet someone and help my career a lot i would continue to do my best at my job i ca n't worry about what others think i just need to do the best job i can do i would be interesting depending on what the project is it would be something i would want to be involved in but only if it appeals to me with further information
i would let my friend take the vacation as i would request a different week if my colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans , then i would assume that he she must 've already booked plans and reservations that cannot be cancelled in addition , i would expect my colleague to do the same for me , to act as a friend i would still do the project even though my boss gives me last minute tasks , i know i still have the capability of completing my tasks and finishing the project i would be frustrated , but i can get the job done i would still go even though i would n't know anyone there i would also try to convince my friend to come with me as one of the largest clients will be at the networking meeting in addition , i would still have a good time even if i went by myself as this networking meeting seems vital for my job i would complain to the board of directors that i was graded harshly and unfairly i would try to explain to my boss that the feedback was not fairly justified and that there should be no real consequences i would also try to make him pay for his consequences as he falsely gave me negative feedback i would find this experience enjoyable because traveling to a new country is already fun enough there are plenty of things to learn including social and cultural differences that i have not experienced before in addition , learning more about the country and culture is simply just more knowledge to your head
i would ask who put in for the vacation first \? would there be a lost of some sort if not taken \? i would ask who has seniority it depends on why the vacation was needed first because it depends on the importance of the vacation i would do my best to concentrate and make sure that i am able to clear the load ahead of time i would take the initiative to ask the boss at ahead of time that i he likes doing last minute task i may have to cut of some me time i would go because you have to try and see if something positive comes out of it there is nothing to lose by going i shows responsibility i would thank my boss for his feedback , let him know what i have done to make best of the situation i would let him know that i will do my best to satisfy him sometimes people disagree i would find this enjoyable because i can find interesting things about the country i love sharing information so this is already apart of my personality this would be a easy task to do
i would be more than happy to change my vacation plans if it does n't involve any extra expense on my part i usually take my vacations during my son 's summer vacation from school , so i usually have two months in which to do what i want however , if there is an extra expense involved , i would ask for my boss to either reconsider or help me with the added cost i know that the girls in my department are perfectly able to do without me because we have organized ourselves in a way that covers all bases i would do a little research on the project and make up a detailed plan if it seems obvious that two weeks is simply not enough because there are factors beyond my control that would not let me complete the project within the timeframe , then i would go back to my boss and explain the situation if the project is feasible within the time frame , then i would focus all of my efforts on the project so that i could finish ahead of time and be able to review with my boss just in case it needs some tweaking i would try to see if one of my other co workers or boss could go with me if not , i would probably try to get out of it because my boss knows that i have my son waiting for me at home normally , i cannot attend after work functions without some notice however , if it is crucial for someone to be there and i am the only one available , i would just go to the event and try to network as much as possible in the shortest amount of time possible i would ask my manager for a meeting to discuss , in detail , the circumstances behind the negative feedback i would want a chance to both to understand and explain my actions if i agree with my manager 's feedback , then i would just accept that i made a mistake and promise to adjust my responses so that they are in line with company policy however , if i still disagree with the reasoning behind the feedback , i would ask for a second meeting involving my manager and his superior or take the issue up with hr i would find this project very intriguing in general , i like to educate myself on different countries and cultures and , since i work with export and imports , i do get a lot of feedback and general knowledge from my foreign clients i would totally volunteer to participate in this project because i have little knowledge about norwegian business and i always want to grow as a person
putting my boss in a difficult situation is not advantageous to me or my colleague it would be weighed against both of us therefore i would pick a different week for my vacation this way all concerned parties would be happy i would pace myself in this situation i would complete this project as quickly as possible , since my workload is light i then would have time for any last minute tasks my boss hands , this would keep my boss happyi would go any way it is after all one of my company 's largest clients and this networking meeting could be very important my not knowing anyone there should not make any real difference i would of course be not very happy with this situation of course i would try and discuss this feedback with my boss this could possibly clear up the matter and work to my advantage after all this negative feedback could be be because of some misunderstaning i would find this experience very enjoyable i love learning about new cultures and countries i would find it very interesting to work with a foreign client this would expand my horizons a lot
i would change to keep the peace and look like the good guy i think that the boss would also remember my act in the future and it would i would be a team player in this event i can take a hit now too get something later i would show my boss that i am handling the project well i would make sure all of my work looks good up to this point then i would ask my boss if he has any tasks that i need to work for him to get this project done i would ask him with enough time to get the extras done i would ask the client to please go i would explain to him her that this is one of our biggest clients and that if we do n't show a united front it could be trouble i would ask them to be a team player i would feel bad and hurt i would ask my boss for a meeting to hear my views i would have evidence if any that the negative feedback about me is not factual i would try to make my case about the negative feedback and how this could affect me and my job i would find this experience very enjoyable and a great learning experience i would be learning about the lifestyle and customs of a nordic country a culture very different from the united states this kind of project could open up new doors
i would wait to take my vacation until my work partner got back i m always flexible , and wouldn t mind picking up the slack until my partner got back from work i would gladly take on the project if i needed to , i would work at home , completing things even if it required me to work all night long i would go to the networking event and make new acquaintances i wouldn t worry that i didn t know anyone and am sure i would know half of the people there by the time i left the meeting i would talk with my manager personally and explain how i felt , and how much i believe i added to the success of the businessi would love the chance to be involved with the project i love learning new things and i would also prove myself with my company i m sure i would do the job well !
i would ask that they honor whichever request was submitted first it would be fair to both parties neither party should feel slighted by this i would get started on my project early this would allow me to better adjust if my boss gives me a last minute task also , there would be no harm done if i finished my project early i would go to the networking meeting it would allow me to expand my contacts it may also prove useful for the future i would ask my boss to provide some examples that support the negative feedback given i would also provide my support as to why i do n't agree with the feedback lastly , i would follow procedure with contesting the negative feedback i would find this experience enjoyable i love learning about new things also , it would show my company that i have initiative
i would try maybe talking to the colleague and make sure they cant change their plans if not then i would have to change my week request for maybe another week thought this would be very upsetting i would probably hurry and get done with the light workload first that is in case the boss throws in more tasks later then i would have time to complete everything if he gave more work at the end i would probably not go as i would not know anyone else there i am a shy quiet person therefore not knowing anyone to talk to would be way too uncomfortable for me to go i would probably try talking to another manager or higher up person about it if it came down to it maybe try reasoning with the manager who gave the bad feedback i would feel pretty angry about this situation i would find this experience enjoyable i have just learning new things and experiences norway is a pretty place and it would be fun to learn more about the culture there
i would assess the entire situation since i am single and have no kids schedules to deal with i 'd assess if my co worker has kids i would then talk privately with my co worker if after conversing with them i see that they have a better reason for needing to take their vacation at that time than me i would back off if they did n't have a good reason i 'd try to parlay my backing off into getting something from them in the future as a trade off i'm a wheeler dealer and always land on my feet one way or another i would do the project right away i ca n't calm down unless my work is done no matter how far off it is i get nervous if my taxes are n't done by mid february if i start the task now i have a lot of time to perfect it and if my boss throws more tasks at me i will have that extra time banked to get them done i would go anyway i have no problem going places alone plus , if my co worker does n't go then my face and name will be the one they all remember i told you i'm a wheeler dealer i would take a hard look at myself if i really am certain that the assessment of my work is unfair i 'd first try to talk to my manager and have them go over point by point with me why they feel i fell short if at the end of that talk i think they are right i will ask how i can improve if however i still think they are wrong i 'd take it up with their boss and have them mediate i would love this in my 20 's i moved overseas to switzerland all alone i knew no one , did n't know the language and did n't have a job set up in advance i went on a whim and stayed 4 years i love learning about new cultures
i would see if i could take vacation in a different week i would have a talk with my colleague and determine why he does n't want to change if his reason is sound and i can change my plans , i would volunteer to change my vacation week i would finish the project early it makes sense to do this since my workload is light also , if my boss is prone to giving me last minute assignments , it behooves me to anticipate that , so that 's another rreason to finish my work early i would find out if it 's important that i be at that meeting sometimes such things are not necessary this is relevant to me since i am shy and going to such a meeting alone , i would not be doing much networking , lol i would talk to my colleague and see if i could twist her arm and get her to go with me , so we could keep each other company and accomplish something at the meeting i would ask to meet with my manager i would present my case that the feedback is not true perhaps the manager got some incorrect information if the manager himself is perpetrating the unfairness , i would use proper channels to lodge a complaint i hope that i can work it out with the manager and straighten things out , though i think i would find it enjoyable i like learning about other countries and cultures i think my eagerness to learn would help me to be enthusiastic and eager to do a good job on the project i actually hope that there would be an opportunity to travel to norway during the project
i would politely ask why they were unable to change their plans and see if we could work something out that would be to both of our benefits maybe i change my plans if they are will to let me be off first the next time i want to go away if that does n't work , keep my plans and leave it up to the manager to decide that should be part of their job anyway i would begin the project early to make sure i have the bulk of it done before the due date they way if something comes up i am not in a bind at the last minute if nothing ended up coming up great , i 'll have a light load around the due date to practice or put on final touches if it was that important of a client i may go and makes the rounds for 15 20 minutes just to show that i made the effort then i would leave early so i could go home and relax and recharge i can fill my co worker in on what happened the next day i would try to figure out where this negative feedback is coming from did something happen that i am being retaliated against for some reason \? talk to my manager about how i feel it is unfair untrue if that does n't work go above that managers head to the next one in chain of command before it goes any further and leads to negative consequences i would find it very exciting and enjoyable i would love to volunteer and learn something new about a client and a different country could be a very valuable experience and may lead to travel down the road
i would first look into who put the request in first and also when the last time the colleague took a vacation with this information i would first appeal to the colleague about changing their vacation again if this is unsuccessful i would go to the supervisor with the information as to who is more entitled to the time off if i have the free time now to handle the project i would work on it leaving anything until the last minute is highly unadvisable as unforeseen circumstances can derail any projected thought completing the project early will allow for the chance to improve it and also shows initiative i would still go to the meeting networking can be key to improving you level at a job not knowing anyone at a networking meeting is a common occurance for a lot of people as networking is meeting new people within your business i would look into exactly what caused the negative feedback if it turned out to be justified i would take steps to change what was wrong and improve the situation if it was not justified and i can present evidence to the contrary would step up and show why the negative comments were not justified if the manager does n't respond to this i would bring it to a higher level i would find this to be enjoyable i feel that if the company is currently dealing with norway it is possible that there may be future dealings with others from norway it would be a good thing to have in my skills and on my resume to have knowledge of the country and self fulfilling to learn more
if i had not planned my vacation yet then i would give in to my colleague however if i had already made plans then i would insist i stick to my original plan the boss needs to decide which of us cna take the vacation leave based on performance and other work related factors i would finish it earlier than expected in this way i would have spare time to do additional work load that my boss will give this gives me an advantage to do the new task to be assigned i would still show up this will give the client the gesture that we are giving importance to him i would show up and just make some excuse to leave early i would approach my manager i would ask him or her how he or she was able to come up with a conclusion about the negative feedback i would reason with him or her and would promise to improve and work on that negative feedback about my work i would find it enjoyable this gives me a chance to learn new things understand another country and their culture and origin
i would consider changing my vacation i would also consider getting a new job , or suggest they hire more people but realistically someone has to budge , so maybe make a compromise either split it up so that you get half the week you want and they get half the week they want or next year whoever changes gets their choice i would try and get it mostly done at the beginning in case the boss does give last tasks i will have time to handle both i would possibly ask the boss if there is anything else coming up i would probably go , depending on my family situation it is always good to get to know clients better it is good for the company and good for you you never know what will happen in the future i would feel very frustrated i would try and see what i could do to change their mind i would maybe try and see if there was something else i could do to get into good favor with the manager i might possibly go above the head of the manager to explain the issues i would find it very enjoyable i love learning about different countries and different cultures and if there were even a remote chance to travel , i am totally in !
i would take a different vacation time and not make an issue out of it i'm not inflexible when it comes to issues like this one as long as i have time off , it does n't really matter when i take it chances are good that my colleague has some sort of family commitment that is involved with his or her vacation plans i personally would not let that stand in my way of changing my plans so , being more flexible , i would re arrange my time off i would first make my boss aware that i would be unable to take on any last minute tasks , given the scope of the new project i feel it important to communicate this information as to not be misunderstood , or have my boss have unrealistic expectations of me i would then proceed with the project i would also lean toward not going i am an introvert , and after a long day , i am not good with people i would rather be a no show than to show up and not be at my social best that would not benefit me or the client i would feel angry and misunderstood i would question my manager as to how he or she arrived at this decision and ask for specifics once i knew the specifics of the situation , i could make an argument to the contrary if necessary however , if my manager gave me a good argument , i would agree to work on my performance i would take this as constructive criticism i would find this experience enjoyable ! i like learning new things about cultures that are different than my own however , i dislike traveling for work so this would offer me the best of both worlds , so to speak !
i would change my dates as long as i would not be losing any money that was already paid towards a vacation trip , such as plane tickets i am a fairly flexible person and i do n't have many family commitments so i am comfortable changing the date of my vacation i might talk to my colleague about what favor they might do for me since i am willing to change my plans , like covering for me in the future for a day off i would make sure that my project was due well ahead of time i would also have a conversation with my boss letting them know about my project and what it entails i would also ask them if they have anything in mind they need me to do in the next two weeks so that i can dedicate my time accordingly between any and all projects i would probably try and encourage them to go with me if they ca n't i might try to find another colleague i know that would go with me ultimately i would go alone if i had to , since this is a chance to network and honestly , i should n't need someone there to network , i need to learn to do that on my own i would schedule a time to sit down with my manager and discuss the feedback i would like to get more details and i would let my boss know i do n't agree with it i would make sure to be prepared in the meeting because if i am disagreeing with them then i need facts to back up my claims i would love the opportunity to work with someone from another country i have a real passion for other cultures so i would be the first one to volunteer i would look at this as an opportunity to connect and learn something and maybe give me more information for a day when i can go to norway for a vacation
i would try and convince my college to accept the later week vacation he dines i would tell him how the vacation is really important to me even if i have to lie of an emergency i would also try and get on the better side of my supervisor so that he can favor me and grant me the vacation i would try my best to finish the project even before the deadline i would also try and explain to my boss of how the project might be taking a lot of my time so as to avoid him giving me last minute tasks if in the middle of the project he gives me a last minute job , i would put it aside and get back to it when i finish the project i would try and convince my college to go with me if he refused i would try to bribe him to for him to introduce him to anyone i would also try to fake an illness for him to have to go and i wont have toi feel bad because i know the feedback could not be true i would try to follow up the feedback so as i would get to know what might have happened i would find the experience boring because i would just have to narrate everything to him about the country 's culture without showing the real deal to him
if i am able to change my vacation to another week i would i do n't see a point in making a big deal out of it if i can easily change the dates it 's vacation , i could take it anytime i want does n't have to be a specific date i would try my best to complete it i am confident that i would be able to do it but if it comes down to the wire i can always ask for help or maybe even an extension i would still go because i would n't want to miss such a great opportunity it sounds like a great opportunity to meet new people and possibly expand my network this would benefit me in my job if i disagreed i would ask to sit down with my manager to discuss the feedback i would politely give reasons why i do n't believe the feedback is true and list reasons and examples to prove all my positive qualities i would find this experience enjoyable i always take delight in learning new things , especially about new cultures there is always something to gain in learning new things
it would depend on if my plans could be changed if they could i would be the bigger person , because for some reason i love being a martyr if they could not be changed i would insist that our supervisor decides for us if they could n't or just would n't we should lose the days off work and just get the extra check i would finish the task first even if it looked like i had time to procrastinate this way my coworkers would have my help if they needed it if my supervisor came to me last minute needing another project , i 'd make hem sweat it i 'd make them believe i had just finished before they left to present them i would go to the networking meeting this is where my sunny disposition would come in handy i make new friends pretty easily i can get along with anyone i would be in this position again hopefully not on my first day of work again i would swallow the anger and ask what if anything , i could do to make it betteri would enjoy it norway with the viking traditions it would totally be great for me but if i had to learn all the new information i would insist on a real life trip
i would not be willing to change plans it is the supervisor 's job to advise on what weeks are available and scheduling it depends on who submitted the vacation request first depending on what i may actually have planned for my vacation , i may or may not be willing to take a different week i would take what time is needed to complete the project in an efficient and accurate manner with that project out of the way , i will be prepared if my boss decides to throw any extra work my way i would bite the bullet and attend the networking meeting attending would show good sportsmanship and manners since i was invited it would also be good to formally introduce myself to one of my largest clients it is a good opportunity to meet new people i would request a private meeting with my manager to discuss specifically the negative aspect of my work i would ask what consequences would this type of feedback carry i would then ask for any positive feedback that could help with any future work i would definitely find the norway experience enjoyable even though it does n't necessarily mean that i would have to travel , it would n't hurt to learn some new things it would convey that i am a team player
this depends on the type of vacation we are going to take if my colleague is going to go with his family to some place and i am going to stay at home to rest , i do not care and i can give my colleague that time i am a very responsible person in my work , if i have to make an effort to perform a special task , i will do it even if it is a sacrifice for me i trust in my ability to do thingsif my colleague has good reasons not to go to the meeting and we have the obligation to go , i will attend even if i do not feel like it if my colleague is the same one that i gave my vacation time i hope it is he who attends to the meeting i could feel very bad but i will try to talk to my manager to understand if this is a personal problem i think that money is always important but that is not why i accept injustice to me personally it would seem an interesting experience because i am a very curious person and i like to know the customs of other cultures i am sure that this task would be very enjoyable for me
i would check the employee handbook to see what is supposed to happen at this point if there are no rules stating that two employees cannot take vacation at the same time i would bring that to my supervisors attention if there is a rule then i would find out how double requests are handled and follow that rule i would outline the project and include a timetable for completion knowing that my boss can give last minute tasks i would build that time to complete 'miscellaneous' tasks into my timeline i would also aim to have the project completed several days early so that any tweaks that need to be made can be made before the official due date i would consider how important networking with this client is what benefit is there to me \? to my company \? i would likely go , but dip out early , letting the client know that i have a long work day the following day so that they are a priority for both me and the company i would go to my manager with my concerns let them know politely that i disagree , but ask for further details on their feedback , ask for examples if they refuse , go to their supervisor if they give you more details take them under consideration before making any further decisions i would absolutely find the experience enjoyable and would volunteer immediately i enjoy learning about other cultures and countries , and would hope that the project would require some travel i think the things i learned on that project would probably also help me going forward on other projects
i would first look at my own vacation plans and see if they are changeable if i were able to move my vacation , i would easily compromise and tell my coworker they could have the week if i could not move my vacation , i would start to make a case for why i needed this week and why i deserved it based on past performance and work history i would then take the case to my supervisor and let them decide i would begin work to complete the project now knowing that my boss might tack on extra work near the due date , i would prioritize getting as much of the project completed as possible if i finished early and my boss has not given me additional work i would make sure the project was perfect then , i would turn it in early and ask what i can work on next i would see if any other co workers would like to attend with me it might give me a chance to get to know someone better if they did not want to go i would probably try to go by myself for a bit and make contact with the important client before excusing myself early i would gather as much evidence as i could to support my claim that this feedback was not accurate i would first take this feedback to my manager and attempt to change his mind and decision if he disregarded my evidence , i would then talk to the supervisor over him and show my evidence for why i deserve my bonus i would find it exciting it would be a different project from what i am used to working on it would also be interesting because i enjoy learning about other cultures i would also keep hoping that it may turn into travel if i do an amazing job !
i would see if my vacation is flexible and change it if it is i would do this because it would keep the peace at work and help my coworker out if this would n't work , i would have a conversation with my coworker about the situation i would get the project prepared immediately i would do this so that i would n't be surprised or affected by last minute tasks once i have the project fully prepared , i can go over my materials closer to the due date to refresh myself and possibly catch anything i 've missed this would really cut down on the amount of work i have to do near the due date i would ask my coworker to come with me i would explain how i would be more comfortable if they were around and that i would really appreciate it if they decide not to go , i would still attend as i think there would be value in going , still i would feel very anxious about the situation in response , i would analyze what was said and see if i can pinpoint exactly what my manager is referring to if i still believe i am right , i would explain this to my manager and provide evidence to support my claims i would find this experience incredibly enjoyable i would absolutely volunteer for the project i think learning about other cultures is fascinating and a valuable use of my time this could be an opportunity to score points at work and enrich myself at the same time
for the sake of the team , i would be flexible enough to change my vacation i would make it clear to the team i am willing to make the change i would also make sure i have sign off on my next vacation i would do this to maintain good team relations i would complete the project early i would not tell my boss i 've completed the project early i would complete the project early to ensure i can turn it in on time and take on any last minute tasks from my boss i would encourage my colleagues to go and make the case as to why they should go regardless if they go or not i would still attend networking with the largest clients is imperative to keeping the customer i would request a follow up meeting with my manager i would respectfully challenge all of the items i did n't agree with in writing and present them to my manager i would keep an open mind , but would not want false information on my work record and certainly would not want to lose a well deserved bonus i would find this experience challenging but exciting and enjoyable the opportunity to expand my horizons both personally and professionally would certain help my career it would make me a more valuable employee
i would definitely move my vacation week in the modern world almost everything is changeable and it is possible to modify or change plans easily so the particular week of my vacation would not be a sticking point with me i have actually done this in the past i would do as much work in the lead up as possible and expect the last minute assignments i would use the lead time to complete as much of the assignment as possible and complete the project if possible i like to go ahead and finish tasks like this early and then tweak anything last minute that may need to change because of updated data i would go ahead and go and take advantage of the opportunity you never know what will come up in this type of meeting it might turn out to be very productive if i went and it was useless or a waste of time i would excuse myself and leave early i would try and get a second look at the data nd try to get an improved evaluation , but if the eval did not improve i would just grin and bear it unfortunately if you are in a job where there is arbitrary idea related items in your evaluation you are sometimes going to get burned so , you have to learn to live with this or get a job that has a quantifiable outcome based evaluation system i would find this enjoyable for a country i had some interest in personally i have always thought it would be fun to visit norway so i would take to this task if the spot was not one i was interested in then it would be more of a chore
my response would depend on several variables not provided in this scenario it would be extremely unlikely that we both requested vacation at the exact same instant therefore , one of us requested vacation first the person who requested it first should have the right of first refusal additionally , it is unknown to me whether either of us have concrete plans personally , i do n't make vacation plans \( like booking flights , hotel rooms , renting condos , etc \) until i have verified that i have the week off from my supervisor if it is just a week i was thinking about , but nothing specific is going on \( say perhaps a wedding \) i 'll happily give up the week and make my plans for another week sometimes i just take off for a week to work on household projects again , i 'd happily switch that to another week in the end , if the colleague requested it first , it should be his if i requested it first , it should be mine but as i say , i 'd give it up if i do n't have anything important going on that week i would get as much of the project work \( that is due in 2 weeks \) out of the way as soon as possible knowing that my workload is currently light and my boss sometimes gives me last minute tasks , i would work as hard as possible to be prepared for that contingency i would also consider checking in with my boss to let him know about the project i'm working on to see if he could give any insight what else he might need in the next two weeks i would absolutely go whether or not my colleague went i would try to convince my colleague that it makes sense for us to go for both our careers and to appropriately represent our organization but if he decided not to go , i would go anyway perhaps it would be awkward , but it is one of our largest clients i can deal with that kind of difficulty i would obviously not be happy about this situation i would first try to gain more context from my manager if it is something i do n't believe is true , that leads to me believe that the feedback is somehow subjective this is another one of those scenarios that leaves out far too many variables to make an accurate determination what i would do i would absolutely volunteer for this project i find other countries and cultures very interesting i would find the experience enjoyable i would actually hope for travel perhaps doing a good job on the project would enable that to become a possibility
i would first compare our vacations and how important they are for example , are they both just fun weekends away \? or is one a very important occasion , e g a wedding , and the other not nearly as meaningful \? if i think my vacation is much more important , i would explain that to my boss and hope that they took my side in this one of the jobs of the supervisor should be to decide these kinds of things when their colleagues cannot reach an agreement if my vacation is not that important or is very easy to change around , i would willingly change it to avoid workplace confrontations i would do it as quickly as possible however , i would not submit it right away this way i can hopefully guarantee that my boss does not give me way more work than i can handle i would still go to the meeting networking is very important , especially with an important client i would try my best to convince my colleague to go as well , though i am much better in situations with new people if i have someone that i know there as well i would feel very upset in this situation i hate being falsely accused however , i would realize that this person has power over my future at the company , so i would do my best to show my manager that i am a valuable employee if i had any kind of definite proof that my manager was incorrect \( e g emails , receipts , etc \) , i would show it to the manager if they refused to believe me , i would take it to the manager 's boss \( assuming i have a decent relationship with them \) i would find this experience enjoyable , though it would be even better if i could visit i like to learn new things about other countries i also always like to take the initiative at work being involved would help me do that and hopefully impress my boss and perhaps some day , i 'll even be able to travel there myself
i would try my best to change my vacation plans to another week i would like to say that i would pull seniority on the co worker who is unwilling to change their plans , but i would n't i do n't like to cause problems i would handle this task to the best of my ability i would do as much of the small tasks well before deadline i would make time for the last minute tasks that i know my boss will throw on me i would try my best to talk my colleague into going to the networking meeting if not able to talk them into going , i would go anyway it maybe helpful in the future to show that i attended with or without the colleague i would tell my manager that the feedback is not true if i loose out on the annual bonus , that 's ok i would rather have my self respect than the money i could n't sleep well at night if i did n't say that i felt needed to be said i would find the experience enjoyable it 's fun to do something different from time to time learning something new is always helpful it may also be noticed that i helped out without being told to do so
if i could , i would adjust my plans with the understanding that if this situation were to happen again , i would receive priority on vacation times i would n't need to cancel or change that many plans since i always check with work far before i book trips i would delve in and expect interruptions if i work diligently and manage my time well , i can accomplish anything i do n't have an issue with interruptions most of my executive positions have involved frequent interruptions i would go and enjoy myself and network with the client i have no issue with meeting new people or being in unfamiliar environments my personality is naturally open and engaging i 'd most likely be fairly angry if the feedback is not true and i would make sure that my disagreement was well noted and documented i firmly believe in constructive feedback for employees instructive and fair , based on actual , definable situations i would find the experience very enjoyable , depending on the client 's personality and attitude i enjoy meeting new people and i love new experiences i also travel locally a lot so i would adequately be able to host this client
i would look at my plans and if possible take one for the team and change my vacation plans i feel like this would not be a huge deal unless hotel reservations ca n't be changed or airline tickets ca n't be refunded if at all possible , you should try and keep harmony at your work place i would get on the project right away it is always best to get things done and out of the way , rather than wait until the last minute you never know what else might come up at work or your personal life , making it harder to complete a task i would explain to my colleague that i am shy and wo n't know anyone i would ask just once if they would change their mind and go with me if not , i would likely suck it up and go since it 's one of my biggest clients and you always want to please them and not have any issues i would ask my manager for a time where we could talk about this issue letting it go is not an option talking it over with them as adults in a calm way is a far better option than letting it go or flying off the handle my reputation could be at stake either way i would volunteer ! i love learning new languages and learning about other cultures is a great way to expand your mind i would find this very fun and enjoyable i would buy a lot of books on norway and look up everything i could on the internet
i would kindly ask him again to change his request and if that did not work i would change my days off because i try to do the nice thing and changing my days off is not a big deal to mei would get with my boss now to see if there is tasks that need to be completed and i would attempt to get them done on the last week leading up to my presentation and get that extra work done earlyas it is part of my job i would have to take my client up on his offer and just grin and bear it for the remainder of the meeting and try to pick up a few new clients from this meeting to make my boss happy and to give me more worki would refuse to sign the report and find out why i received such bad grades from my manager and if that did not work i would go above his head to find out the low marksi like to find out about all i can from different countries and i would really enjoy and find out everything i could about norway and try to run with it in some presentations
i would agree to change my week for betterment of our office i think i could make my plans work out whenever and would not be tied to the date i would however request that my colleague give me something for giving up the date and would try to extract something from my boss as well i'm a team player but i have to watch out for myself as well i would finish the project way ahead of schedule i would not let the light workload cause me to slack off i would get the work done now and that would free me up for any other that comes down the pike i would go definitely its a large client we are talking about and we have to do whatever it takes to make the client happy and to show we are invested in them i would be glad to represent our office at the mixer i would fight my manager if i did n't feel the information was accurate i would do whatever i could and talk to anyone above my manager to clear my name i think that , since it is serious , i would have no choice but to fight this i would even confront the manager and demand an explanation for the feedback i would find it enjoyable i think i would love the norwegian culture and anything that can give me a learning experience i am all for i would hope that it would include travel as well as it would be a joy to go to norway
i would check if i switched it to the following week or previous week would it make a difference if i have made commitments with others or have non refundable reservations i would speak to the coworker i would ask if they had were in a similiar situation and explain my situation if the same i would try to work out something if unable i would let whoever signed up first go as scheduled i tried my best to not cause any long term hurt feelings i would work at regular speed to start then if another project came up i would be done and available depending on what comes up i with check with others if they need help if no project comes with a week to go i would check with the boss and ask if they had something for me i would reinforce how important the meeting is maybe suggest lets take a break and then go to the meeting if they are unable to go i would ask if there were 2 or 3 people i should make contact with explain in a tactful way we had a very long day at work and my colleague is unable to make it i hate this situation it really bothers me when someone says something untrue i would find documentation that supports i did the wright thing and very politely explain to the boss if is not open to discussion i would go to his boss bad habit i have i would find this experience very exciting and enjoyable i like to learn about new places and their culture it would be fun to work with someone from norway who may have a different way of thinking norway is a beautiful place and would find out about a couple and maybe bring up in conversation
i would bring it up to the supervisor and explain that we are going to be absent i feel it 's important that everyone is treated fairly , i would n't say to him that you deserve more because then he will take advantage of me i would explain to my boss that it is to much work for me to handle i would n't want to let my boss down if i knew i could n't handle the stress i i would ask my boss to assign those tasks to someone else i would go because my success depends on these largest clients i would try my best to meet new people it 's important be a leader and not a follower anyway 'i would sit down with him and discuss with him my performance i also would tell him that you do know that i am working my ass out everyday you do know that your feedback determines my bonuses that i deserve i would find the experience to be rewarding because not many people have this chance to learn about cultures i would also would love to try their foods i would also like to maybe share what i have learned
i would try to move my vacation for later time if could n't push it then i guess will go on the vacation i would try to finish my project first before the deadline and if my boss keeps giving me side jobs i would do over time to finish the project i would try to convince my colleague to go with me if they still deny then i would try my best to get connected to the client and leave the good impression i would feel sad about the situation and try to solve it with the manager if he does n't change his mind i might try to report this incident to his supervisor i might find it boring if am not travelling because what 's the point of learning anything if travel is not included that 's the most exciting part for any project
i would ask them what is so pressing about their plans depending on their answer , i would decide whether to bargain with them or absolute refuse most likely , i would try to offer them the vacation time they want in exchange for some money or other incentive i would approach it methodically essentially i would break it down into equal parts until the due date however , in doing so , i would account for extra time in my schedule each day in the chance that my boss adds extra work in i would weigh the options of who could possibly be there if there was a conncection attending i was hoping to get in good with , i would go if there was nobody worth networking with in attendance , i would stay home and skip going i would ask a few people what they would do if they were me then i would think about their advice and weigh it against my own preconceived plan to go to hr and explain everything that happened i guess the best thing to do would be to look for proof i 'd feel very exasperated that 's for sure i would find it boring there 's no mention of a bonus or any incentive for completing this project why would i find extra work enjoyable \? personally , i would n't
if it was impossible to get my colleague to change their vacation plans , i would probably try to change mine i would see if there was another week available that i could take off the reason for this would be to keep peace with my colleague and also help my company during this time i would make myself available to work during the time that my colleague was on vacation i would work on this project as much as possible during my spare time if my boss gives me last minute tasks to do , i would just make sure he is aware that i have this project to accomplish also if need be , i might work overtime in order to finish the project i would definitely go it sounds like this is an important meeting it does n't matter if i do n't know anyone there this is an opportunity to get to know my client better and meet others i would arrange to have a meeting with my manager and try to explain my position i would listen to his side of the story and then try to explain the situation i would hope that he would listen and change his position but , if this is not the case , i would just have to take the consequences of his decision i would be interested in this project i like to learn new things different countries and cultures are somewhat interesting to me i think the experience could be enjoyable
i would go ahead and change my plans i would want to help the company it may also show the boss i am dedicated to the job i would work on the project a little at a time daily i would schedule a set amount of time to work on the project each day and stick to it this would leave time available for other projects that may come up i would go anyway if my colleague did not attend this is afterall a networking meeting it would give me a chance to meet some new people i would be very upset and frustrated i would try to discuss the matter calmly with my supervisor i would explain why i disagreed with their assessment i would find this experience very enjoyable it would be a chance to help someone learn about my culture i would be excited to also learn from the other person
i feel i would approach them and ask if there 's any way to change their vacation days i 'd also like to know if i had sent in my request before they did if i did , i would mention that i had put in a request before they did i would probably change my vacation time if they were unwillingi would make sure i have my work done before hand i would also check in with my boss to make sure there are no last minute revisions the week and a half before and i would also check again a week before the due date stating that i would need time to devote to the projecti would still go if i had been personally invited by a client to go , i would go and network even though i would know no one there , i would still stay for however long and leave when i wanted to i would feel pretty nervous and upset with myself with negative feedback that could carry real consequences i would ask my manager for a brief meeting to discuss their report and defend myself i would also ask the standing of my bonus i would find it a enjoyable i think learning about new cultures and people 's ways of living is interesting i do n't know much about norway , so this would be a real learning experience
typically , i am very flexible person and would adjust my vacation dates i am of the belief that it 's a minor inconvenience and that me prioritizing work will benefit me in the long term i would tackle the project immediately it is better to take more time and do it right than rush and make simple mistakes i am also the type of person that ca n't leave projects unfinished or unattended to i would go it is an opportunity , and advancing in your career is all about taking advantage of opportunities trust the leadership you have to believe they are in the their position for a reason even if it turns out to be true , going against the wishes of your superior always has negative consequences i would find it enjoyable it is again an opportunity for a career advancement this scenario assumes they are the first client from norway , and should my company want to expand their business in norway , i would want to be the leader and most knowledgeable on the subject
i would see who requested the week off first i think that whoever requested the week off last should be the person to change their vacation plans i might be willing to change my plans if i can do so without change fees or it was n't completely necessary that i be somewhere for something specific i would get the project done well in advance of the deadline i would not want to take a chance of my boss giving me last minute tasks that would prevent me from finishing my project if i put it off i would not rush the project due but work on it enough each day that i have plenty of time if anything else comes up i would encourage my colleague to go and both agree to only stay for a short period of time i believe that the networking meeting would be important and that we should at least make an appearance i would n't want to go alone but i do n't think it 's good for business to skip the meeting i would make an appointment to speak with my manager in private i would wait a few days to do so , because i 'd probably be upset and want some time to cool down i 'd make a list of talking points that i could use to defend myself so i'm prepared i would love this experience i love to see new places and new cultures and i 'd really enjoy traveling to norway to learn about the country i would most certainly volunteer to be involved
i would talk to my colleague and tell them that since i do n't have plans to travel for my vacation , i will take different week however , the next time we choose vacation weeks , i get first choice for which week i want if you want the same week next time , you need to stand down and work and allow me to take the requested time off i would immediately start thinking about the project and start making an outline of what steps need to be done to accomplish the tasks then i would start on the project , working on one task from my list at a time my goal would be to have the project completed 3 days ahead of schedule which would give me flexibility in case a snag came up or we got really busy as each different task was completed , would cross it off my list and begin the next task compiling the project as i go even though i am tired and have had a hard day , i would freshen up and put on my happy face and go to the networking meeting not knowing anyone there could be a problem , but it is a chance to get to meet new people and not be held back by having to hang out with any one person would probably set a time that i would want to leave , and would make sure that i mingled and introduced myself around the room would head back to my work area and try and write down everything that my manager just told me would make a bullet list of the hard facts that they gave me regarding my work then i would do some investigating to determine if the data he gave me actually lines up with the work that i have produced would not waste time on being angry , would turn that emotion into working to determine if i had a valid problem or not if i could prove from my data that the feedback they gave me was wrong , would document it in written and provide a copy to my manager as well as their manager and human resources i would jump at the change to learn about a new culture if travel was involved , that would be an even bigger bonus working on a project for a new client would give me an opportunity to show what the company i work for is capable of doing , and would give me a new challenge
if i do n't have plane tickets or a firm reason why i need that week off , i would change my vacation dates to accommodate for the busyness at work i would do this so as not to create any type of conflict with my colleague i would also do this to continue to be in good standing with my boss i would try to get this project done ahead of times by giving myself daily goals i would do this just incase i am given a late assignment this would be something i would be willing to work over time on , but would prefer not to i would try to muster up the courage confidence to go by myself if i did end up going , i would only stay for a little bit as i do n't feel that i am great at small talk i would make sure that that those i am in the networking meeting with know which organization i am with so we are represented i would feel upset over this situation i would make sure to talk to hr about this as well as ask for another sit down with my boss i would want to hear an explanation and make sure to get my own side of things out in the open i would find the experience enjoyable i love to learn about other cultures , in fact it is one of my goals in life i would gladly volunteer to be on this project as i think it would challenge me and my knowledge would grow
i would accept to move my vacation date i do n't want to cause any issues and i feel that i could easily change my plans i also do n't want to be confrontational i would first remind my boss of the current project that i have then i would ask him if i could postpone the new tasks that he gave me then i would focus on the project that was due in two weeks i may not go because i tend not to see the benefit of networking events i might also be uncomfortable going by myself i would decide not to go and try to find another way to meet the client first , i would try to arrange a meeting with my manager to discuss my feedback i would like for my manager to explain each point one by one and show me exactly what in my work deserved that feedback if the manager does not respond , i would then go to the senior manager for help as well as get colleagues and other supervisors' support i would find it very interesting and exciting to travel to another country for work even if i was n't able to travel , learning about a completely different culture would very enjoyable to me i tend to like learning about other cultures in my spare time , so having it be a part of work would be very beneficial for me
unless i had some important trip planned , i would request for a different week of vacation maybe just the week before of after my colleague if i do have something already planned for the week i will also not move my vacation week i would work on the project little by little throughout the week i would be prepared if there is a suddenly large workload if my boss does decide to assign new tasks i would still try to go by myself it 's a networking meeting after all , so the point is to make new connections if ever i do feel tired , i can just leave if i do n't feel like i'm doing anything productive i would just do it the way the manager requested i would not want to miss my bonuses i would find that really interesting i think that it 's always fun to learn about new countries and cultures , and this way i would also be able to connect with other clients from the same country if anything , i would also love to travel to norway one day
i would just reschedule my vacation for the following week i would n't make a big deal about it i would definitely schedule my vacation for the next year alittle early to get the week i want i would work on my project steadily while my work flow is slow just incase my boss gave me some last minute things to do i 'd still have adequate time overall , i 'd try to get my project done as soon as possible i would encourage my colleague to go since i did n't know anyone else i 'd know for sure if my colleague did n't go i 'd still have to i 'd end up going with them and making the best impression i could i would ask my manager where i can look up the things he spoke about to find out more about it i might call a different manager maybe higher up to discuss this with them i may start looking for another job i would find this experience enjoying i 'd feel proud they chose me i would be happy to get a change of atmosphere at work
i 'd consider how important it would be for myself to postpone vacation plans if i could not make changes in the schedule , i myself would be just as stubborn in not willing to change if this created conflict , so be it if schedule could be changed , i would do so to avoid unnecessary conflict i myself am very prone to procrastination that being the case , i 'd remain slow and steady with the gamble of my boss dropping more work on me this could be risky , but i would probably be able to handle added stress resentment for my boss i would still go it is important to network having a safety buddy to give confidence is n't going to help anymore than just being alone social skills need to be exercised i 'd still go regardless i 'd bite the bullet and hold my tongue bread needs to come to the table i have a family and need the money pride is one thing , financial security another i 'd hope it to be an enjoyable experience norway could be a nice place , so too the people hopefully , coworkers are tolerable and pace is relaxed
i would change my plans and go on vacation another week i would be annoyed that my coworker wo n't help out the situation i think it is more important to take a vacation at a different time than not take on at all i would begin my project as soon as possible i do n't like the feeling of being rushed while working on something there is a possibility that my boss could give me a last minute project and i would have to rush through both projects then i would try hard to get my colleague to join me i know how it would help the company , but would n't want to go alone i would work hard to change their mind about attending with me i feel upset and mad at the situation my job is important to me though so i would focus on what i could do to make my boss happy i would work on improving i wouldnt be too excited about this experience i would n't really enjoy learning all of the stuff without actually being able to travel to the country
i would talk to my colleague and i would explain the reasons of my decision if after the conversation he continues with the idea to take the vacations , i would evaluate the change of my vacations i would change it if the reasons of my colleague are good for himself and his family i would talk to my boss and explain him the way i am doing my project i also would let him know the importance of the project , so he can understand that i need time at least for the weeks to come i would go because i feel is important for my professional career to get there i would try to get as much information as i can about the people who will be present i would get more information about the most important person present i feel bad and i would ask him for the reason of the bad review i would find this experience very interesting i like to interact with people from other cultures scandinavian culture is amazing and if i have to travel i would be very happy
if i was able to change my plans i would if i was not able to change my plans , i would find out who asked first and then that person should be allowed to take off i would be super frustrated and try and handle it well i would go ahead and complete the project early that way i would not have to stress about then when my boss gives me a task last minute , i would be done with the project i would not go to the meeting i am an introvert and ca n't imagine that i would do well not knowing anyone i would be sad to miss the opportunity though i would be super upset i would email my manager with ways that his her feedback is wrong and ask for a response i would also explain i would like the bonus so maybe we could compromise on meeting in the middle i would find the experience enjoyable i would be able to learn something new and possibly get to go to norway also it would look good if i volunteered for this
i would either ask the supervisor to pick by seniority or if myself or the other person has a trip planned that cannot be changed or refunded star on the project as soon as possible trying to get as much done as i can before those last minute unexpected tasks get piled on who knows maybe i would have it completed before the tasks show upif my coworker really wanted to just go home i would let them why miss out on a event that could help my career in the long run just because i wo n't know anyone at first no one really knows anyone before they meet anyhow depending on what kind of feedback it was i would if i could prove that the negative feedback is in correct if i cannot prove it then i would make sure to take a second look at things to make sure i'm not missing something personally i would love it knowledge is power and who does n't want to learn new things to experience a new culture new history is a great thing to me
if possible i would change the date of my vacation this will show my boss that i care about the company and my job this will bring a good light to my loyalty to the company i would try to finish early i would not let the boss know we are ahead of schedule this way if he does have another project we can get it done too i would try to talk my colleague into going keeping clients happy is the best way to get repeat business i would also like to be introduced to this client for future events if this information is not true , i would prove it to my manager if he will not face the facts i will go over his head the bonus is most likely need by me i would be the first to volunteer for this account i love learning about people from all over the world i feel this project will be very enjoyable and profitable
i would be willing to change my vacation plans to keep peace in the office however , i would make a mental note that i have done this if this issue were to come up again in the future with this same colleague i would recall this mental note and how i willingly changed my vacation plans to accommodate theirs we all need to be flexible in the office to be sure everyone gets their time off to get refreshed and come back to work renewed i would work with due diligence and great focus with organization on this project i would keep in the front of my mind that at anytime my boss could give me a last minute project that could take a significant amount of time , that could completely derail the time management of my project i definitely would not take my time completing my project because i never know what project my boss could drop on my desk at anytime and how much time i would have to put into it i would make my current project a priority and complete it and get it out of the way , to make time for other last minute projects that might get assigned to me i would n't go if my colleague was n't going to attend being that we both have had a long day at work , i would n't be at my best for this networking meeting not being at my best and not knowing anyone there , means i would n't be representing myself or my company 100 percent it would be to my advantage to go home and destress from my long work day and to prepare for tomorrow and go to work feeling refreshed i would listen intently as my manager gave my negative feedback i would listen to them without interrupting when they were done , i would speak up and respond to their viewpoint i would question their feedback and give the facts from my point of view i would explain the whole scenario that is in question my attitude would be , surely they must be basing this feedback on either partial information or they are missing some information of the scenario i would want to make sure they knew all of the facts if at that point , they clearly had all of the facts , and they still had the same point of view , i would graciously and respectfully accept their negative feedback i would work diligently at their request and suggestions to improve on whatever their recommendations were i would find this experience very exciting not needing to travel to the country itself , but still needing to learn about the country and culture sounds refreshing to me it is a way to enrich not only my personal values but , my professional value within my company i would jump at the chance to volunteer to be involved in this project
i would start by trying to bargain with them i would offer to work for them a different week if they let me take my vacation on the week planned if they do n't budge , i might offer them a little money to reschedule their vacation if we could n't reach an agreement , i would suggest flipping a coin or drawing straws to see who gets to take the vacation that week i would go to my boss and inform them of the deadline i have coming up i would request that he or she gives any last minute tasks to another employee who does n't have any pressing deadlines i would offer to pick up much more slack and take on more tasks after the deadline has passed i would inform them that if i'm given any extra tasks , my priority would remain my project and the tasks would have to wait i would first ask them to go politely i would offer to buy dinner and or drinks and take care of their travel if they come i would explain that i do n't know anyone there and it would be awkward for me if they do n't come if they still wo n't come , i would just go by myself and try to meet people i would first try to figure out what the negative feedback was and if it was or was n't accurate if it is accurate , i would accept the consequences if it was n't , i would gather all relevant paperwork and proof and confront my manager about the oversight i would calmly but firmly explain to them the mistake and how it might impact me i would find the experience very rewarding and interesting i 've always been interested in other countries and culture and would jump at the opportunity to learn about norway i would definitely volunteer for the project and do as much research as possible who knows , i might even visit norway on my own dime after researching it
i would tell my co worker if we ca n't decide between the two of us we need to find another solution flipping a coin is fair heads , i get the week off tails , you get the week off if the co worker was n't agreeing to this , i would just give them the week off and make them look bad for not being fair i would focus on getting the project done if i sit there and worry about what will happen later i wo n't get anything done i would go to the networking meeting anyway without my co worker because i feel it is important and would show how much i care this is one of my biggest clients i feel that i have to show them appreciation i feel like i would stand my ground and tell the boss how i felt if i was confident that he was wrong just because they have the title of a supervisor does n't mean they can run over me as a person i feel i need to stand my ground i would find this experience enjoyable because i love learning about other countries , people , and cultures i often search up this info on the web i get pleasure out of learning about other cultures and the interesting things people do in other countries
i would fight for my preferred days off we might negotiate and meet each other half way if necessary , i 'd get a third party involved i would take my time and wait until near the end date to finish the project unless there 's bonus for the last minute tasks i do n't want to be stressed out for no reason i would go it 's a great chance to prove myself to my employer and an important client this would be a chance for me to prove that i deserve a promotion i would come talk to my manager i 'd want them to properly explain the reason behind every single feedback i would feel very upset it 'd find it quite boring unless i could go to norway , the culture learning process does n't interest me much i 'd take the project if there 's bonus
i would change my dates if it was reasonable to do so however depending on who first submitted the vacation request should be allowed to have that time the other person who submitted last should be required to change their dates i would begin right away on the assignment i would n't want to be rushed or run out of time i would work hard to get it done correctly and without overwhelming myself i would try to convince them that we can go together that way it would be more comfortable for both of us it would be a good opportunity for both of us i would try to discuss it with my boss maybe we could find a compromise that way we would be able to work together and both groups would be happy i would want to do what my boss wants , it would be hard to lose a annual bonus however i could n't change my beliefs i would find it more enjoyable if there was traveling involved it would be fun to see the country while learning about the culture it would make it more interesting
if it was convenient for me i would change my plans however if it was something important like my daughters marriage i would refuse i would appeal to my super and give evidence of its importance i would volunteer to work extra the week before i would complete the project well before the due date , just in case i am able to get it done so i would that way if the boss gives me any last minute tasks it wont throw me off i would first make an appeal to my colleague to attend together if they dont i still might go , it just depends how busy i am at that time if it was important that one of us goes i would probably do it i would be unhappy and not let it slide i would go to hr and give personal evidence to support my case i would also elicit support of others who know my work ethics and productivity it depends on how busy i am if i have to learn things about the country on my own time , i probably would not volunteer however if it were on the job studies i would find it interesting and probably volunteer
i would have a discussion with my colleague my willingness to change my time would be dependent upon why i wanted the vacation if i were going to a wedding or some fixed time event , i would explain that i would start working on the project as soon as i could if i knew my boss gives me last minute projects , i would n't want to feel stressed if i have too much to do while my workload is light is the best time to get work done i would go to the event if the networking event is with one of my largest clients and i thought it would help my career , i would go for maybe an hour i would look at the event as an extension of my workday if i thought it would help me i would follow the company protocol for disputing the feedback some places have processes in place when you disagree with feedback or evaluations i would make sure my position was clearly documented i would want to refute the feedback with evidence particularly if a bonus were involved i would find this experience enjoyable i am interested in other cultures i would n't necessarily want to have to put in endless amount of time finding things out but if it were in the course of my day , i would gladly volunteer
i would first approach my colleague and try to work things out it would be convenient if my colleague were to change their plans , but that does n't seem to be the case if my colleague 's plans are really that important , then i would just change my vacation to another week i would go about my business as usual , but try to prepare myself for any of the last minute tasks it 's best to be prepared and try not to let stress overtake you i would first try to persuade my colleague to attend the meeting if they decline , then i would just suck it up and try to meet new people at the networking meeting i would speak with my manager and try to right all of the wrongs if they oblige , then things are fine if they do n't listen , then i would n't try to fret too much about it i would definitely find the experience enjoyable i enjoy learning about different cultures and how things are done in other countries you do n't necessarily need to travel to learn about the culture of another country
i would most likely change my vacation plans unless i had already purchased tickets however , having had this experience in the past , i know not to make vacation plans without being granted approval first therefore , i would adjust my schedule however , i would make a note of it and make sure the next time the other employee had to make concessions i would work on the project as long as i have light work done i would make an effort to complete the project earlier than expected that way , if i had last tasks to do closer to the due date , the project would not suffer i would still go to the networking meeting with the clients the clients clearly wanted us there , and that is the reason they invited us i would try to convince my coworker that they should attend , also however , i would make the most of the experience , either way i would make sure that i developed a sound and convincing argument to ensure that my side of the story is told adequately i would gather evidence , such as reports , work assignments , feedback from my manager , and other internal and external customers i would present this information to my manager and to my manager 's boss i would find learning about norway to be enjoyable i believe learning about different countries and cultures is interesting also , it helps me understand how that country maybe affected my own country and culture
i would determined if my plans could be changed my flexibility could be viewed favorably in the future my willingness to cooperate could lead to future opportunities i would discuss my decision with my family in order to determine the best course of action for the long term i would work diligently on the project and not wait until the last minute this way i could have more time for fine tuning near the deadline if i m given additional work , this would also allow me the time to focus without feeling a time stress i would weigh the pros and cons of attending the networking event how often do i interact with this client \? would it be in my best interests to attend \? i wouldn t enjoy the party , but often simply being present is enough to make yourself memorable i would schedule a one on one meeting with my supervisor to discuss the review i would ask for specific points and for clarification then we would create a plan to help me improve my performance for future reviews i would find this project extremely enjoyable my paternal grandfather can from norway , so this would be a great way to learn about my roots additionally , i m fascinated with other people and cultures this would be enjoyable on several levels
i would discuss the situation with the colleague and determine why they were so steadfast if the reason was acceptable , i would try to negotiate some offset from them in the future , such as the right to first choice on a key vacation time or to alternate choices if the colleague 's reason was poor or selfish , i would escalate i would complete the background research immediately i would outline the steps , sequence of tasks soon so that if there were any avoidable constraints or missing info , i could handle them i would then work this project into my other work in blocks of 2 4 hours at a time until it was complete , even if this was significantly ahead of time there are always high value tasks to do for work as an introvert , this would be a challenge for me i would try to convince the colleague to attend if not , i would prepare for the meeting by researching the attendees and preparing small talk subjects ahead of time i would do my best to enjoy the interaction on a personal and business level i would thank the manager for the feedback and ask for more details , context , etc i would provide counter evidence to the manager and request a change if the manager would not modify , i would escalate to their manager or hr at a minimum i would ensure my version of the facts was kept in the hr records this would be an appealing assignment i enjoy learning about new topics , especially foreign cultures this would add to my resume and experience set the option value of the project is also attractive
i would let the other person have the vacation time i 's a would not want to have problems with them at work i can always reschedule my plans and i do n't think it 's a big deal i would start off working as hard as i can on current issues at the same time i would leave room knowing that my boss may add more work if my boss added more work i would work that into my schedule accordingly and i would n't be upset i would still go to the meeting even if they did n't want to i would have no problem meeting with people i do n't know i also think networking is very important in any company i would be very upset to hear this news i would go above my managers head to prove my case i would n't want my bonus or anything else being affected for something i did n't do i think this would be a very exciting experience it would give me an opportunity to help someone learn about this country and i'm sure i would learn some things about theirs as well i would be eager to help and learn new things
i would see if there was any way i could switch vacation times with him if he was unwilling i would ask my boss if there was a way i could take my vacation at a later time when no one else was taking their 's i would get it done as soon as i could do it just in case something came up and my boss gave me a late project i would make sure the work was done right with no mistakes so that i did not have to look over it before i gave it to my boss i would ask them if there is anyway that they could go if they could if there was not i would ask them if there was any way that maybe a friend that knew someone at the party could come with me in his place if none were doable i would go alone i would feel like i did not do anything to make him feel that way about me and would ask him to explain more why he felt that way if he was unwilling to do so if it were possiable i would go above him to whoever he reports to and tell them about the feedback he gave i would find it a god experience because it would let me experience a different part of the world that i had never seen before it would be good to help learn about how companies in other parts of the world do bussiness
i would say that i'm not willing to change my plans either and that for all fairness we would have to flip a coin or ask our supervisor if there 's a way they can decide for us i also think that if there is a role that is busier during that point in the year , that person should be the one to stay ultimately i would heed the feedback of my supervisor and what they decide i would try to work on the project as much as possible and not wait until the last minute knowing that my boss gives me tasks that can come unexpected , i would need to prepare for the worst i would try to spend a chunk of each time everyday to make progress on the project i would plead with my colleague to come with me since it is such a major client and it would look better for our company if my colleague still is n't convinced , i would go to the networking meeting along simply because i knew what a big deal it would be i do n't have issues walking into a room where i do n't know anyone , i will make friends while there i would feel uncertain about how to proceed i think one little feedback should n't jeopardize my annual bonus i would probably still try to respond to the feedback and make changes that would appease the manager most feedback has some sort of relevancy , so maybe if i do n't agree with it on some level , i believe there could still be a change to make i would find this experience very enjoyable ! i love a good challenge and i especially love learning about new cultures places i would find it exciting to be partnering up on an international level , and to be a part of that !
i would n't back down my vacation is just as important as someone else s i would stand my ground if the supervisor made me take a different week i would call in sick on the week i wanted the vacation i would be very careful to not let the boss think i had a light workload i would complain about the project not going well and not admit i had it done until i knew there was no chance of getting screwed with additional work i certainly would n't go i would n't have gone in the first place when the day is done i am done working unless they pay me overtime i do n't work past the quitting time i would go to the union steward the manager is just trying to save money to his benefit i suspect the union could give me some help with that i would not find it enjoyable why would you volunteer for something at work you work to get paid not to have enjoyment enjoyment is available in your free time it would be nice to learn about norway but it should be done with no strings attached
i would discuss this with them but i really feel i would let them keep that week off and pick another week for myself i have no family nor pets and i am therefore able to be quite flexible with my time , which might not be the case with this colleague i would not worry too much because i like to have project ready a bit before the deadline in general if my workload right now is light , i would do my best to finish the project , keeping in mind the possibility of perhaps a bigger task thrown in my way i would have to think about this i might try to talk with my colleague and see if they would be up to coming with me even if for an hour so we are seen and show up if they do n't want to come , i think i would go to show up and then make a hasty \( ish \) exit when appropriate i would feel upset as i always do when receiving negative feedback i need to take a moment to chew on the feedback to be able to see where the critique is coming from and where i can improve my tactic here would probably be to take some space , maybe have a cup of coffee , write the critique down on my notebook and then , sentence by sentence , try to analyse it rationally to find my balance and be able to see where i could do differently in the future i would definitely find it interesting ! i am a firm believer of the saying of learn as you would live forever and i think knowledge is power this information about the culture and country of norway could easily benefit me later in life and being willing to learn would also make me look good in the eyes of the employer
i would probably defer to my co worker my vacations are usually somewhat flexible so it would n't be a big deal i would also look like a good teammate i would work hard at the beginning of the two week time frame to try to finish it i would also put aside some time later in the two weeks for anything that comes up last minute i would try to anticipate those tasks my boss might give me i would still go i would look good to the company i might get some free food too ! i would probably complain to my coworkers i might politely bring it up with my boss i would be mad if i did n't get to travel there i might be upset i would still like to learn about the culture , food , people , history , etc because i enjoy that it might lead to an opportunity down the road
i would try to find out what they had planned if my vacation was flexible i would change it if it was something i could not change i would go on the vacation i would not leave it to last minute i would get right to the task and complete it in the event that i would be given some extra tasks i would want to make sure everything is done and not left to last minute i would tell them that i am going and we should go together i would say it will be fun and the networking we could do i would n't go if they do n't go i would be upset and i would talk to my boss i would want to know why he thought that way and explain myself to them i would want to get my point across and try not loose out on the bonus i like to travel and i find learning about new people , culture and places is exciting i would overall enjoy this and be happy to go to a new place i would prefer a warmer place
i would converse with my colleague about it and see if there is any wiggle room on when they can go if they are unwilling to budge , i would ask them if they wanted to flip a coin for it if they were unwilling to do that , i would see who submitted first , and if it is mine i would insist that they work instead of me i would try and get the project finished as quickly as possible i do n't want this project hanging over my head over the next two weeks unless , i get busy with other stuff in the first week , i would do the project as quickly as possible i would try and convince my colleague to go insisting that i will be there with him or her all night if that does not work , i would try and convince other people we both know to come with us if that does not work and no one wants to go to the meeting , then i will simply not go i would not know anyone there and i do n't want that pressure of talking to new people all night i feel bad about this situation the first thing that i would do is to look over my work a couple of times to see if this negative feedback has any merit at all if it is has merit , then i would just accept it , if i truly believe that my work is top quality , i would try and go over his or her head to his or her boss to try and rectify the situation yes , that may put me in a worse situation , but do i really want to work at a place where i can receive negative feedback on quality work the short answer is both some things would be boring and others would be enjoyable i would likely not volunteer for this project because i know nothing about norway at all but if no one wanted to do it , i would do it , and in the process earn some respect \( and future considerations \) from the people that i work with
i would see who put in for the week first if it was me , i would either negotiate to get some advantage in passing up my week for another or stick with keeping my current week if i had plans for that week with someone else , i would not want to have to cancel because of this problem i would try to complete the project as much as i could to stay ahead of any last minute task i figure if most of the work is done , the added work would be better handled if i did not have to divide my time if somehow there is no added task then i could use the time to better perfect the project i would attend the networking meeting although i may not know anyone there , i can still try to connect with people and build a working relationship with people i may not have ever known i believe this would be most beneficial to my career and would show my current employer my commitment to my job it is a great opportunity i would find time to speak with my manager to discuss the feedback i would want to see what could be done and to confirm if there are any misunderstandings i would not want a misunderstanding to affect my place at work i would feel upset but would control that feeling when interacting with my manager i would find this experience a bit boring i have little to no interest in norway and having to learn about a country and culture that does not interest me would be boring if it were for a country that i cared more about , i would find it enjoyable and as a great motivation to learning more about the culture
the above paragraph suggests that i requested vacation first so , to my mind , i should be the one to get it but in the interest of cooperation , i 'd talk to the other person to see if he she really needed to take the vacation that week and compare it to my own situation if it would be easy to change my own plans than i would let the the other person take that week if not , i would talk to my manager and try to get some feedback about what i should do the bottom line is that i would never fight over vacation time if the other person wanted that week that much , i 'd just let him her have it i do n't like waiting until the last minute to do anything so if i was given a project to do , i 'd do it and finish it , right away waiting until the last minute is dangerous because you never know what will come up that will end up making your original project late i would go tired or not , it 's a business meeting and who ever can come , should come it would n't matter if i did n't personally know anyone i find it easy to talk to most people , even though i never met them i would feel very negative about and very confusion as well , if i felt like the feedback was unfair i would definitely talk to my manager and find out how he she came to that decision if he she was right , then i would try to do better if i still felt that i was judged unfairly , then i would go over his her head and request a meeting with whoever was above him her i would n't find it enjoyable or boring i guess i would classify it as uninteresting i'm really not into learning the culture of different countries i would turn out the offer
i personally would let him have the time granted i had n't paid for a vacation plane fare , hotel etc if i did , i 'd have to argue the fact with him otherwise , i 'd let him have the week off if he 's unwilling to change his plans he 's probably a real sweetheart to work with not i would prepare i would consistently and constantly ask my boss if he has any last minute changes i would do that to try and get those in order so i could finish the project if i did get last minute task , i would forge on , i 'd have toi would go part of work is networking if this is the same colleague that would n't budge on the vacation time i was supposed to take , i 'd rather go without him however , i would try and talk him into it , because after all , we both work for the same company otherwise i 'd go , i would feel it as a duty i would ask for some concrete proof in what , why and how was this negative feedback if i really thought it was undeserved i would ask him for the facts what exactly did i do wrong it could be a misunderstanding i would have to look it over and decide whether i did do something in error i would volunteer probably only if there was time and i could pick up some of the language , however i would ask the company to pick up the cost of language courses if they did decide there was going to be travel , i have my passport ready as long as the guy who would n't budge on the vacation thing was not going
i would except whatever decision the supervisor makes on who gets to go on a vacation , and who doesn t i would also hope that my colleague would accept the decision as well i think that it is ultimately up to the supervisor who gets the time off i would work as hard on it as i can while i have the free time especially if my boss my designed me more work are usually don t like to procrastinate anyway , especially if there s a potential of a bigger workload in the future i would more than likely still go i do not care of my cold it goes or not if i don t know anyone there , it is an opportunity to meet people this will probably be a valuable networking experience that i don t want to mess i would make sure that i approach human resources in order to appeal this feedback especially when potential consequences are at stake i am sure that there is a procedure to follow to a pill any feedback from a manager i would preferred to be able to travel to norway however , this will still be an exciting , and educational experience to learn more about the culture there i would eagerly looking forward to this assignment
as long as i did n't have any vacation plans for that week , or anything that i was not able to change , i would take a different week off for vacation i would start working on the project as soon as i could , even if i could n't get it finished immediately at least i had started it , that way i would have most of it finished by the time it was due , in case i was given any last minute tasks or projects i would still go since it had to do with work , and it was my responsibility to go to a meeting with one of our largest clients if i do not go it could work against me or look bad , especially if i did n't go just because i would n't know anybody there i would take into consideration what the manager said , as it reflects on certain aspects if it could have serious consequences then i would do what i needed to do in order for those consequences not to happen i would find this somewhat interesting , and would probably enjoy the chance to learn about the country it would help me in progressing in my work environment as well as educate myself about other people 's lifestyles
i would make the argument to my supervisor about why my vacation ca n't be changed , if applicable i would then ask the supervisor to handle the situation and choose who gets to take vacation it 's the role of the supervisor to make this decision , not of the two employees to work it out i would try to get as much of the project done ahead of schedule to leave room for unexpected last minute tasks if my boss did then give me a last minute task and i did n't have time to do everything , i 'd ask for guidance on how to prioritize i might work extra hours to get everything done i would go it 's important to have face time with important clients , and if i do n't go , no one will i'm also pretty comfortable in situations where i do n't know people , so this would n't be a burden on me first , i would reflect on the situation to see if there 's any truth to the feedback i would then gather any evidence i had to dispute the feedback , such as metrics and positive emails from colleagues , and ask to meet with my supervisor i 'd lay out my case for why the feedback may be untrue and suggest ways i can improve in that area as well i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about other cultures also this opportunity seems like it could be an opportunity for travel , which i enjoy
i would ask my colleague again if there was any way that he or she would consider taking his or her vacation the week before or the week after the week in question if they are n't able to reschedule their plans i would look at my own plans to see if there was any room for rescheduling so i could take my vacation a week before or a week after if that is possible i would go ahead and rearrange my plans to accommodate my coworker 's vacation time if it is not possible then i would accept the fact that i would not be able to take my vacation that week since it is very understandable that we would not be able to take the same week off i would work on my project as usual but i would be sure to not dawdle and prioritize my time when completing the project i would put it first and check to see if any other tasks i have going on could wait until after the project is finished this would ensure that the project is finished before the due date just in case my boss chose to delegate any other tasks to me last minute if my boss did give me a task before the project was finished i would remind him or her that i am still working on the project and i would like to finish it first before i took on any more tasks that needed my immediate attention i would do what i could to get my coworker to understand how important this meeting is to the both of us and remind him or her of what good could come from us attending if my coworker is still adamant about not going to the meeting i would just go alone i would probably be uncomfortable but not knowing anyone there is n't reason enough for me to not go attending could possibly open up lots of opportunities for me so i would definitely not miss the chance to attend i would be annoyed with the feedback but i would just accept it and move on i would look deeper into the feedback and see if there was some truth to it and maybe i am just not seeing it from my point of view i would possibly even ask to set up a meeting with my manager to see if he or she could give me some help with the problems that were brought up and let it be known that i am trying to do my best after that i would put that advice to work and do what i could to improve in the areas i received feedback in i would find the experience very enjoyable learning about new places and cultures is always exciting and having this knowledge could put me ahead of others in my company and give me opportunities that others are not qualified for also , if the need to travel to norway does arise i would be ready for the task and i would not be forced to learn all of that last minute and i would be well prepared
unless my plans were urgent or time sensitive , i would probably be willing to change the week of my vacation i would speak with my colleague and try to find out why he or she is so unwilling to change if their plans are more urgent or time sensitive than mine , i 'd agree that they should take that week off if mine plans were more important , i 'd try to convince my colleague to change his her mind i would try to finish most of the project early that way , i would have time to also do any last minute projects my boss assigned to me if it turns out that my boss does not throw me any last minute work , then i will have time to fine tune the final details of the project in a leisurely manner i would mostly likely still attend the meeting i would feel it 's important to keep my largest client happy and would feel remiss if i did n't go the fact that i do n't know anyone there does n't bother me very much because it 's usually easy to meet people and engage in casual conversation with them however , i probably would n't stay very long because i was tired i would be upset and angry , and i would speak with my manager about it however , i would wait until i had calmed down first i would think about what i would say to my manager ahead of time so that i would n't say something in the meeting with him her that i 'd regret i 'd remain calm and present my manager with rational , reasonable reasons why i disagree with their assessment of me and i would respectfully request that they change their feedback i would be thrilled to work on this deal i love learning about other countries and cultures , and interacting with people from them i would love to travel to norway and , even though this particulare project would not require me to , it might lead to future projects with the company which would allow me to travel there
i would first ask my colleague if we could talk i 'd then find out what their plans were and if we could come to some kind of compromise if not , if i had something pre planned , i'm going anyway i would look at my calendar to find out what i already have scheduled to do i 'd then find out where i can fit the project into my schedule once that 's planned out i 'd work as hard as i could to complete the given task plus what i already have to do i would ask my colleague why they are n't going and why i 'd then ask if there 's anyway they could try to go so that i would n't be alone if not , i 'd probably decide not to go but would n't necessarily blame my colleague i would feel like i'm not good at my job and that would hurt i would ask my manager why be gave the feedback that he gave and why \? i 'd then find out how i could improve i would not find the experience enjoyable because i do n't want to learn about a place i ca n't travel to i 'd be a bit disappointed but i 'd probably still volunteer this is n't my type of thing , though
i usually ask for vacation well ahead of time , so i would probably be okay with changing as long as i did not have some specific reason for those dates , i would not be too upset probably i would think whoever asked first should get it i would try and do as much as possible ahead of time that way if i get a last minute project , i will still have time to complete both since workload is light right now i would be able to devote time to the two week project knowing that i can put the finishing touches on later i would not go i hate going to networking events and i would not want to attend if i did not know anyone else i would not have wanted to go even if my colleague was going to attend , so that is an easy decision i would be very upset i would probably need to wait to talk to someone about it after i had calmed down i would want to think through the situation and decide what my options are before i address the issue i would love it actually i love learning about other places but would not be able to travel right now because of my kids this sounds like it would be a very rewarding experience
i would check with the supervisor to see who put their request in first if it was me , i would tell my co worker that i had already secured those dates if he was first , then i would change my plans i believe the first one to submit the request should be the person who has that time off i would start working on the project now and put in some extra time that way if he asks me to do other things before the deadline i wo n't be under so much pressure maybe spend an extra 30 minutes per day on the project to ensure it gets done i would still go to the function it will be good for the company to have someone there also , it would be good for me to network and strengthen the relationship with the client i would address the issue with him her and explain why i do n't think it was correct if the problem ca n't be resolved , i would go over there head to their supervisor it 's not somethign you sit back and take , i would be excited to embrace the challenge it would be a great experience for me on the professional side and also give me a chance to see the world i think it could help my career as well
i would probably be willing to be flexible i'm able to have a good time in just about any time and place , so having my vacation tied to a particular week does n't feel essential to me i would hope that the coworker would be appreciative and help me if i needed it later i would try to do much of the project as quickly as i could i 'd hope to have it roughly finished a few days early then i 'd spend the final days putting on the finishing touches , but would also have time to take on any emergency tasks i would go anyway , and try to make the best of the event i 'd introduce myself to people , and see if i could make professional connections on my own i 'd follow up with my new connections in hopes of working with them in the future i would ask my manager if we could have a meeting to discuss this further i 'd attempt to lay out my case for my perspective i would try to get a better understanding of where my manager got those ideas about me i 'd ask how i could improve and if i could do anything to improve my standing i would find this experience very enjoyable i have experience as a travel writer and i'm used to researching places that are new to me i enjoy learning about other cultures
i would be disappointed that i was not going to be able to get the time i wanted off however , i would not put up a fight and would let me colleague have the time off i would reschedule my vacation for a convenient time for myself and the company i would try to get started on it as quickly as possible knowing there is a possibility my boss could put something else into my workload i would want to get ahead of it i would hope that by working ahead i was just getting everything done and could relax i would ask my colleague to go with me i would say that i would be there and we could stick together i would also emphasize that it would be important to go due to the client being there i would discuss the feedback further with my manager i would try to show how the feedback was not accurate and demonstrate it i would try to find out why my manager believed this to be true i would be excited to be part of the project i would find it exciting to learn more about the country and culture i think this would be a very enjoyable experience
i would ask my colleague why they needed that time i would ask if it were possible to be moved i would then try and move my commitment if i could i would try to get as much done with the project as soon as possible i would want to be prepared for whatever comes last minute i would just try to be as available as possible i would try to convince my coworker to go i would try and get them to see the positives that came with going regardless , i would go to the meeting i would look more deeply into how this happened then , i would try to explain myself i would make it a point to try and make my manager understand i would enjoy the experience i have an interest in the nation of norway as it is i would even volunteer to travel
i would change the week of my vacation as long as i did n't have to make cancellations that would cost me money , or miss going to something that could not be rescheduled , it would n't be too big of a deal for me i would n't consider it worth the time and energy to argue with my colleague over who gets the vacation week i would make sure that the project was done long before the due date if i finish the project early , i can use the rest of the time to tweak and perfect it as well , i would be able to keep my workload light , and be ready for any last minute tasks the boss gave to me i would most likely go anyway while i would want to try to convince my colleague to go , i know i would n't be able to force them , so i would have to tough it out myself plus , the meeting would be too valuable to pass up , and by attending , i would be able to prove myself to the company and the client , which would be a great advantage for me i would have an open and honest discussion with my manager i would ask what specifically led to the negative feedback , so i could improve upon it in the future most of all , i would try not to lose my temper or seem desperate i would find this experience enjoyable i love learning about cultures and countries i 've never experienced before , and would find it very enriching to learn i would also like to be able to put my new knowledge to use to help out the company any way i could
i would feel that i would have no choice but to change my vacation plans i would not want to make the company suffer for my absence and i think it will make me look better in the long run to be flexiable with my vacation request to my management i would n't be very happy about it and would resent the co worker who refused to change thier vacation plans , but i would not want to lose my job over something so petty i would use the time to get the first project done during my light work load time i would try and fit it into my daily tasks so that it is broken up into smaller activities and is not overwhelming i would then strive to have all of the project done prior to the due date that would insure that if my boss throws any last minuite tasks at me , i will not be stressed out trying to complete more than one project at the last min i would not go i am not a very soical person and would be very uncomfortable going by myself if it was required that i be there , i would go but if it is n't i would feel no need to attend being in a room with people i do not know is not the worst thing , but if it is avoidable , i will avoid it i would politely question my manager to get a good understanding of what the negative feedback means for my job if it is something that if done will affect me negativly i would want to speak to my managers boss to get further clarification on why i am being told this feedback and should i change the way i am doing something to comply with my manager if it would hurt me to not change what i am doing , and i feel like i should n't have to change , i would ask my manager to fully explain why change is necessary and then follow through with their feedback i would not want to lose my job due to not agreeing with my manager i would want to volunteer for this assignment becuase learning about another culture would be very interesting even if travel is not involved , i feel it could be bennifical to me to learn from this client and help make their experience better any time there is an opportunity to break up the normal workday with something new and different would be enjoyable to anyone
i would take my vacation later it really is not a big deal to me , i can wait also , i prefer to keep the peace rather than incite disagreement or any kind of social friction working well as a team is very important i would get the project done ahead of time procrastinating on anything more often than not leads to difficulties and sometimes disasters i much rather need to take a bit of time to adjust my work and not start too late it is far better to be prepared all the time for what may come or at the very least be prepared to deal with the consequences i would go anyway networking is the backbone of any successful business i would also take a recording device and take notes that was i could go over details later i would also be able to share with my colleague so that they could be filled in on anything they missed i would not be happy about this situation i would cover all of my basis step back , take a logical view to what is going on if this is true , i go to my manager and find out if there is anything i can do to fix what is wrong how could i improve and ensure this is not repeated if it is not true see if i can reason with my manager if not , trust in god if things become unbearable , perhaps look for a more suitable line of work i would be more than happy to volunteer i really enjoy history and culture i also have a deep love for education and experience almost everything we can learn can be useful in general
i would try to come up with some type of compromise i would go to my supervisor and have a conversation i would ask my supervisor to honor the request of whoever requested first i have been in these types of situations before what i always do is get right to work i use whatever free time i have to complete my project i do not wait till the due date i am someone who does not allow other people 's decisions to determine my actions i would definitely attend the the networking meeting i enjoy the opportunity to get to meet new people i feel really disappointed with this situation i would definitely set up a meeting with my manager i would ask for some clarity as to how my manager arrived to that evaluation i would definitely volunteer to be involved in this project i love learning about different cultures i never hesitate to cease an opportunity to learn something new about diverse cultures
i believe sometimes you have to make some sacrifices to ensure efficiency in your place of work so i would rather reschedule my vacation for another dayi would constantly update my boss on the changes made on the project , so he can suggest relevant modifications to me made as the project progressesi would try as much as possible to convince my colleagues to attend the meeting due to its severity but if they refuse to budge , i would try to familiarize myself with the clientsi would lay out my complain to my boss in the most subtle and professional manner and try to make him understand my point of viewi feel it would be an enjoyable experience to me because learning diverse cultures broadens my knowledge and makes me see the world in a different perspectives and to me thats paramount
it would depend on the situation , but i would probably change with the person i would n't make any big plans without requesting , and making sure i received the time off , well in advance but if i really needed the time off i would try to work something out with the other employee , and worse case scenario i would request to know who asked for the time off first , as that would be a fair way to deal with it i 've found that a lot of times , criteria for the project will change at the last minute and if i try to finish it early it would be wasted time i would still work on the project , i would just not be in a hurry to get it done early so i 'd pace myself and not rush , but also not leave it all until the last minute i would go for a short time at least i have no worries about not knowing anyone there it 's a networking meeting so the point is to meet new people if it 's awful , i can sneak out after a short while it 's not like anyone will know me , so no problem getting out the door when i'm ready probably nothing in my company , if you complain about your boss , you 're probably going to be let go i would quietly look for another job so i did n't have to deal with that my work is not my whole life it 's just one aspect of it and there 's no reason to stay in a place where you 're not valued enjoyable i always like learning new things and i think it would look great on a resume travel or not , it would be fine with me plus you never know what good opportunities will await you until you try something new
depending on what the vacation was about , i would probably be the bigger person and just wait for another time if they are unwilling to budge then it 's worth it to be seen as the more mature figure i would approach this in a way where i would work on a little each day it would lighten the work load and also insure that you would be fine regardless of what may happen in the future it will help ease your mind as well i probably would not go if it was n't mandatory or practical if it pertains to my career then i would go it all depends on the circumstances i would feel a bit uncomfortable with the topic and the confrontation that being said , i would still try to explain my reasoning and my opinion i would do this in a genuine manner so we could have a valid discussion i would find this experience enjoyable to me , it sounds like a free trip granted , it is for work , but that does n't mean you would n't find time to spend exploring their culture at leisure
i would change mine i would be pissed though i would be cold to them after that i would just be chill with it i would work slow i would doddle and goof off just because i could i would not go the day has already dragged on long enough and i want to go home to my dogs i do n't care enough to go deal with that scene i would go over their head i would find whoever was over them and go complain i would make my case with them i would like it it would be cool i'm half norwegian i could teach them about the us and they could teach me about my roots
i would take a different week it could be my colleague has reservations he ca n't change , or perhaps he 's just being stubborn in any event , he wo n't change , so i will have to i would complete the project as quickly as i can unexpected events do occur , and the boss has a way of giving me more work , so i might as well get it out of the way besides , it 's always good to get ahead of things i would definitely try to talk my colleague into going i would explain to him that i do n't know anyone there if that does n't work , about all i can do is ask my colleague to tell me about the people i will be meeting i would be pretty angry about it i would find out if there were any way to rebut the manager 's statements if i really feel it is unfair , i would start looking for another job i 've been to norway in the military , and i like the people , so i would probably find it enjoyable i'm glad it does n't involve traveling , especially if it 's winter i would pretty quickly volunteer for the project
i would first try seeing if they would be willing to trade some other days with me if that is a possibility if that did not work i would see who asked for the time off first the person who asked first should have the time and i would bring this to the attention of my manager if we asked at the same time i would see who took time off most recently the person who took time off more recently should concede to the other i would do my best to get the work done early in the case that some other project is given to me if i am unable to finish the project before more work is given to me i would let my boss know the situation i would then finish the projects as my boss and i agree i would ask my colleague if there are any people that will be there that i should be sure to connect with aside from our clients i would then introduce myself to these people to become better acquainted with those who will be networking with this client this would be in addition to showing up to show the client my commitment to serving their interests i would be upset that i got feedback that was not only negative but untrue i would seek to prove through concrete numbers or other testimonials to show that the review was incorrect if my direct supervisor did not respond to this information i would speak to their boss i would absolutely love this opportunity i love to learn about new languages and cultures i also feel that it is very important when doing business with companies overseas to see things from their perspective and to show that it matters to you
i would begin to look for alternative dates for my vacation if i had higher seniority than my co worker i would present this to my supervisor to get the preferred week off if this was not the case , i 'd just have to change my plans i would try to get the project done as soon as possible since the current workload is light this would leave me time to complete any other tasks that my boss assigns to me at a later date in this case , procrastination would likely not pay off firstly , i would try to convince my colleague to go even though he really does not want to and give him reasons why he should participate next , i 'd probably to guilt trip him into going if these attempts do n't work , i 'd still go by myself since it is always a good idea to cater to large clients i would argue the negative feedback with facts on why i feel he is incorrect with his assessment since i almost always perform at a high level of accuracy and customer service , i would be slightly offended by the negative feedback i would ask him to reconsider his feedback i would love to have this experience it is always a good thing to learn and be involved with new places it would be an interesting project to work on
i would first take a close look at my vacation plans to see if they would be easy to change if so , i would likely switch my vacation to a different week since it would not matter much to me in the event that my plans could not change without great inconvenience or cost , the course of action would depend on the order in which the vacations were requested if i had requested the vacation first , i would mention this to the colleague and insist that they must change their schedule i would create a detailed plan schedule for completing the project which distributed the work in such a way that i would have extra time in case i was given extra tasks this plan would also include some flexibility such that i could change tasks to different days for example , if i continued to have a light schedule i could expedite some of the tasks for the project and do them earlier , or if i was given extra tasks then i could make some delays all this would ideally lead to the project being done regardless of extra tasks as long as the plan is followed and used wisely i would seriously consider going on my own since the point behind a networking meeting is to meet people you do not already know therefore , knowing no one means greater capacity to network and make new connections i do acknowledge that having a few acquaintances can make the networking easier , but passing up an opportunity just because of being alone would be wasteful i would first speak with my manager in order to get more details about the feedback a meeting like that would allow me to clarify some of the criticisms and present my counterarguments that might sway my manager 's opinion of the work if my manager 's feedback was unchanged by our meeting , i would \( in the same meeting or another meeting \) try to glean constructive feedback about how i could do better or make up for my failures this willingness to improve would ideally mitigate some of the negative consequences of my previous poor performance i would find this experience particularly enjoyable because i find learning about other cultures fascinating this kind of learning leads to discovering new foods and new cultural items like books and films which i might find very enjoyable personal preferences aside , an opportunity like this would make me more valuable in the workplace since i would carry specific , prized knowledge that could be used for other clients in the future
i would do it , because i know my supervisor is being mindful f the reactions from both of us also , i would use this against them later i am vengeful sometimes i know that a situation like this may come up in the future i would start immediately doing so will give me time to correct any errors it was also leave room for last minute projects my boss may come up with i would go i may ne a few new contacts , and expand my network i also want to be more socially active i would feel worried i feel that in many cases that this is the precursor to being terminated i might want to start reaching out to view other opportunities i would like this experience it is neat to learn about other cultures you might visit that country one day
i would tell him that he is kinda a jerk for refusing to even negotiate something but that i will stay and work because he is a jerk i would let him know that he should not ask me for any favors ever again and that he is a bad team playeri would do my part to make sure i finish them all while also letting him know that i am under tons of pressure i would reiterate this and do my best to make sure i can finish all of it i would not be happy though but i have no choice as it is my job i would go because i tend to do well in these situations i would feel comfortable just going and doing my best to meet people there i would not mind going at it alone no big deal for me i would be upset and probably start looking for a new job once stuff like this happens you have to leave usually things like this do not get better as a whole i would love to and would because it would be a great and enjoyable opportunity as i love learning about new cultures i love stuff like this and would actively take on this role
i would probably not change my plans for vacation because it would cause everyone in my family to have to change their plans as well if the plans and reservations , as well as time requested off of work have already been approved by their supervisors and other arrangements made i would explain that my family has already made arrangements with their employers , schools , etc this would be something very important to me , because i do not make last minute vacation plans i plan well in advance i would not wait until the last minute i always try to have projects done well in advance of the due date exactly for the reason that unexpected things happen all the time i am not a procrastinator i would probably go if the client is very important to me or my employer whether or not i know anyone or not this is a great opportunity to meet other potential clients in person it may be a little uncomfortable , but as a professional , i feel it would be my responsibility to attend if possible i would express to my manager that i do n't understand the feedback that was given to me , and ask for further explanation if it is tied to something that i have personally done , or not done , then i will assess whether it should be challenged further , or if it is reasonable depending on the organization i would either contact hr or contact the next level supervisor with my complaint if i did not agree after receiving further explanation i would find this experience very enjoyable as i have an extended family member from another scandinavian country , and would enjoy learning as much as possible about the country and culture i would absolutely volunteer for this project i also like to limit my travel for business , so i think this would be a perfect fit for me
i would take vacation at a different time the reason being my family is flexible and would accommodate my colleague will appreciate my gesture and my boss will treat this favorably i would start it early and try to finish ahead of time learning from the past pattern , if there is any last minute project that i need to work on , i 'll be ready this will also give me peace of mind and avoid unnecessary pressure and this will also put me in a better light i would still go to the networking meeting i like meeting new people and enjoy talking to them even if i do n't know anyone there , it will be good to attend an event where i'm invited by our largest client it will not be appropriate to not have any presence from our company i would be upset i 'll definitely ask my manager for more details and remind him all the important work that i did in a timely fashion i 'll also remind how much extra time i had put in if the manager sticks to his or her position , and if i feel it is unfair , probably i will start looking for a new job i would find this interesting to some extent if it involved traveling to the new country and spending some time there to learn about the country and people , it would have been more exciting however , i 'll still volunteer for this and try to learn more about it through websites and online videos
i would offer to stay at work i would give up my week for a different week as long as i did n't have something that was only doable at a specific time i would do this because as a christian i believe that i should sacrfice my time when necessary while my work load is light i would put extra time and effort into the project that is due in 2 weeks by doing this i would have ample time to do whatever extra tasks my boss would throw at me i would do this because it would relieve stress and make the job go smoother i would still go , my colleague 's going or not going would not have an effect on my decision either way i think that the clients needs are of utmost importance and need to be addressed at the earliest convenience i would do this because it has been my experience that keeping clients happy is the best way to promote the company and build new business first i would talk to the manager and find out why he she thinks this way i would then give my reasons for my disagreement with the assessment , hoping to change his her mind if this does n't work i will go to my managers supervisor and plead my case there i would do this because i take my work seriously and believe that i always do my best which is always above and beyond what is called for or expected i would find the experience enjoyable i love taking the time to find out about our customers needs and wants the expectation of the customer is always paramount in my opinion i would find this enjoyable because i love learning about new places and cultures so that i can expand my knowledge of the world
i would not change my vacation plans unless it were beneficial to me if i were able to get something covered , then sure the other coworker would have to make it worth it i would finish the project early if my boss has shown me who they are and how they lead , i ll choose to believe it there is no harm in being over prepared i would go i would not go for that long , but since they are an important client i would make an appearance i d try to guilt my coworker into coming as well i would be angry , and really hurt i d probably take it personal i d try to correct it with my manager first , then their supervisor then perhaps quit if not happy i would find it enjoyable learning about culture is a two way street i would also be the client s favorite and most familiar person
i would go ahead and change my vacation plans i spend a lot of time at work and need to get along with my co workers hopefully by sacrificing that particular week , i show i'm professional and easy to work with i would start laying down the basics of the project for example , if this involved a powerpoint presentation , i would go ahead and set up the slides i would also have a good idea of what research would need to be done i would be hesitant to go at first since i am a natural introvert however , i realize i am an introvert and intentionally work to be more outgoing this meeting would be a great opportunity to do this and to network , which will help my career i would definitely go to the meeting i would initially be upset that i unfairly received negative feedback i would do some research to see if the feedback was actually justified and take action to fix the items brought to my attention this would please the manager and show my co workers i can accept construction feedback i would find this experience enjoyable i do like to learn new things and have the opportunity to share the information i would consider it a pro to learn these new things , but not actually have to leave home and travel to norway
i would see if there is a compromise or if who 's plans are more important i would like to see we can work something out and i am willing to change another alternative would be finding someone else for coverage i would divide it into smaller tasks i would also ask coworkers for help if they can i would just continue to work as normal i would convince him or her to go if not , i would lean towards not going although i might go if i can find another coworker i would talk and be honest with my manager i would ask for suggestions how to be better i would also try to work more efficiently i would find it boring just because i would not want to go i would prefer to work in the city i live in i would suggest they find someone else
in this kind of a situation , i would just surrender i would let the other coworker take the vacation and just go another time it is an inconvenience , but i took this job so i have to deal with it i would finish up the project i do n't want to get swamped with work and not be able to finish it i would ox everything up if i had that many things to do i would get over it and go part of my job is to network and i want to keep the client so , i take some xanax and get to the meeting i feel disappointed and confused i dont know what i did wrong i want to argue it , but i could get in more trouble if i do , i would take it on i love working with people from other places i also love learning about other cultures
i would also not be willing to change my plans i 've made vacation plans for almost a year and everything is set it is impossible for to cancel everything just because two of us ca n't take vacation the same week i would put in for leave of absence to be able take my week vacation i would not procrastinate and get the project done early so i wo n't have to worry about it later that way if my boss chooses to give me more unexpected work , my project is already finished and the is no need to worry about it leaving the project til the last minute would only stress me out with little time i would take a chance and go by myself if needed i would n't pass out the opportunity of networking with one of my largest clients it should be a great opportunity for business and to get to meet for people for future business i would talk to my manager to see what they based themselves on my evaluation this situation would make me feel disappointed not knowing where i went wrong i would try to prove them wrong and show them the great job i 've been doing i would find this experience enjoyable i love learning about different cultures and other countries this would just give me an opportunity to learn more
i would maybe see who has worked there longer i would maybe see who has higher ranking at the company i would see if i could get a better deal on my vacation a different date try and work as quickly as they can on the big project so that if any little projects come along i ll be able to do them i could also tell my boss about the deadline if he gives me any small projects letting him know that i already have the bigger one to do and i would do that so that he doesn t give me more than i can handle i would try to talk them into going i would say i don t want to go alone i could also go by myself just to make an appearance i would tell them that they wouldn t like to have to go alone so i don t like to go out either i would tell my boss i disagree i would tell them how i feel and i would maybe ask other employees if they agree with the review i would do this because it obviously affects my job pretty heavily so if it s important then i have to say something i would be hesitant to learn about the country i would be hesitant because that s an awful lot of work for somebody who might not be a client forever and i feel like it s not necessarily important information that affects my life personally and i already have other things going on so i don t think i would want to waste my free time learning about that
i would change my vacation plans cheerfully and not worry about it this provides for better outcomes for my relationships with my colleague and with my supervisor it also preserves or enhances my reputation most importantly , it simplifies my life and makes me happiest my reponse is the most rational response i can make the specifics of time off from work are generally not critical i would complete it as soon as possible , and be savvy enough to leave variables that i can account for if the passage of time affects the particulars of the project i would be vigilant for surprises i would have contingency plans in place for such surprises , insofar as is practicable the meeting seems important i would go without question or hesitation work comes before leisure i would dispute the feedback using the appropriate mechanisms if i succeeded , i would be gratified if i failed , i would accept the outcome and learn from it upon reflection i would apply the lessons learned this might entail changing my approach to my work , improving my relationship with my manager , or finding a new job on the face of it i would enjoy it i maintain a mild to moderate interest in nordic culture i would gladly travel if called to do so my interest is based on the history of the nordic countries' contributions to christendom , their pre christian pagan mythology , their maritime and nautical aspects , and their weathers of note is also their sad reversion to paganism and the social and political costs of this reversion
i would consider my colleague 's wishes and try my best to reschedule my vacation i would be upset but still try to be the bigger person i would attempt to finish the current project as fast as possible knowing that my boss could spring another task on me at any moment would make me pick up the pace i would encourage my colleague to attend the meeting with me because of the potential clientele we could gain professionally if they still insisted on not attending , i would attend by myself i feel that this situation could be resolved by talking to my boss and expressing why i do n't agree with the feedback i would ask how my boss determined the feedback if my boss agreed to reconsider , there would be a chance of the feedback changing i would view the potential experience to be very enjoyable i think it could be fun to talk to this person about their culture while sharing mine as well
i would also not change my plans i would ask the supervisor who put in their plans first and grant it to them you do not want to seem like a pushover because then people will walk all over you i would put in a lot of overtime and take work home in order to get all of my projects done i am a very hard worker and would not want to let my bosses down i take work very seriously so would want to complete everything i would convince them to go and go with them since it is one of our largest clients , it is very necessary to go if they choose to not go , then i would go by myself i would look over any paper work and any comments or feedback he gave me if there were , i would look over them before going to talk to my boss if there was nothing , i would go talk to my boss and explain why i disagree i would find the experience very boring since it is volunteer work , it is completely on your own with no pay it would be more interesting if you did get to travel , but since you just need to learn the culture for no pay , i would not
i would ask if i could work remotely from wherever i planned to go for my vacation if so , then i would just deal with it and work while away , as i would not want to be confrontational however , if i could not work remotely during this time , then i would talk to my colleague about our plans and see if we ca n't reach some agreement i would start the project now , but not be in a rush to get it done right away that is , i would probably slack off some and take my time , though i would aim to get a lot of it done during around the middle of that time in case last minute tasks come up i would also want to not wait until the last minute in case something comes up with the project itself that makes it take longer than expected i would try to convince my colleague to go , as it seems like it would be very important for me \( us \) to go moreover , since i am not usually super social when it comes to being around people i do n't know , i would find it rather hard to go alone i would probably not go if they do n't go because on top of not knowing anyone , i would be very tired anyway i would feel really bad , as well as frustrated , about this situation i would talk to my manager about why they are providing this feedback , especially since i do n't believe it is true , and see if i ca n't explain what i believe is true in contrast if it is true in the end , i would discuss how i might try to address the negative feedback to correct what i have been doing poorly wrong i would find this experience mostly enjoyable , as i like learning about other cultures it would also be interesting to work with a client from another country it might be a bit boring though if i do n't get to travel , as i would n't have that aspect to look forward to
i would let them take the vacation my schedule is typically flexible and i could reschedule for a different week it would be no issue i would work hard on it and finish it as soon as possible i do not procrastinate and would not want to be able to finish it on time if i make good time progressing , i would slow down , but only if i am confident if i can finish it on time i want to do the best job possible i would go networking is useful in the workplace and even if i do n't know anyone i could meet new people it would suck but it could be really beneficial i would do my best to correct the behavior and not do it i have been told i take criticism well my boss is also the one who calls the shots and decides how the job is done , not me the experience would be enjoyable to me i love to learn new things , and have been to norway i loved it there , and would love to be involved with something norway based , even if i do n't travel
i would accede and change my vacation plans i would make sure that my supervisor somehow knew it was me who changed their plans i would like knowing that my coworker sort of owes me one for doing this for him her i would try to break the project into smaller chunks and slowly tackle them i would allow myself to work at a leisurely but steady pace that way , if i had to cram at the end because i was assigned other tasks , it would n't be bad because i already had a lot completed i would n't go unless my colleague goes i would try to convince my colleague to go with me if i could n't , i would probably feign a headache and go home instead i feel very frustrated and defeated i would set up a meeting to explain the situation to my manager i would make sure he understood what had happened and would persist until he removed the negative feedback i would find the experience exciting and fun i would volunteer to take it on , and would do a great job of it i love learning about exotic locations , so this assignment would thrill me
i would first discern how mutable my plans were if i did n't have any friends or family counting on me being off that week , i would n't mind changing if i had already made plans or reservations , i would speak with my supervisor presumably i had already requested the week off and should have priority because of iti would approach my boss and ask if there 's anything coming up that i might not be aware of then , if i did n't get a concrete answer , i would try to get the work done fairly quickly just in case something did pop up it seems like my boss is n't the greatest at budgeting time themselves , and i do n't want to be caught off guardi would try to convince them to attend of course i do n't enjoy networking at all so i could commiserate about that , but it 's also a great opportunity with the both of us there , we could both be more effective and more comfortablei would take a second to process what i 've been told and formulate an appropriate response then , i would do my best to really understand where they 're coming from and reconcile their observation with my experience hopefully we can better understand each others' position and figure out what problems there actually are if anyi would love to be involved in this project especially if i got to travel i'm woefully ignorant when it comes to the customs and culture of norway , and i 'd enjoy having the opportunity to learn hopefully i can expand my horizons a little bit
i would let the coworker have the vacation time , if i was able to change my plans in which case i would make a deal with the co work that i get to chose first next time if i could not change my plans , i would tell my boss to make the decision i would take on the work , and not worry about a last minute project popping up i do n't mind staying late to finish work i would go i view this as an opportunity to grow my network , and get ahead of a colleague this is a win win i would tell the manager that i disagreed with his assessment i would make that clear in person , and try to convince him otherwise if i felt he was unconvinced i would be sure to tell him in writing that i disagreed i would find this very enjoyable i like learning about other cultures , and it would advance my career
i would ask whether there were alternate arrangements that could be made so that we could both take vacation at the same time , such as completing some work ahead of time or rescheduling projects i would also check to see which of the two of us asked first i would check with the colleague as to why they ca n't reschedule , and if it 's a good reason , i would change my vacation request i would first make sure to remind my boss that i have this project in the works , and that it is a priority if i am given last minute tasks , i would ask what the priority is , and make sure that my boss has visibility into what other work needs to be done if last minute tasks come up that i ca n't deal with myself in the right timeframe , i would ask whether colleagues can assist with them i would probably go anyway , and use it as an opportunity to meet new people i would probably leave early though if i were really burned out , i might skip the meeting as well i would first gather all the facts for the points i do n't agree with , and organize my thoughts i would then discuss them with my manager if i feel my manager is truly being unfair , i would escalate the issue to my manager 's manager , or to hr i'm actually in the process of doing this in real life i would find this enjoyable , as i would enjoy learning cultural things and having contact with people from another country i would likely volunteer for this project i would also likely look for opportunities to travel
i would plan my vacation later and give priority to my colleague per his needs i would talk with my family members and share the next vacation dates with them so that they can prepare accordingly my supervisor will be relieved as wo n't face staffing issues my work life and personal life both are important for me , so i would postpone my vacation dates considering my colleagues urgency i would share all my major work with my colleagues before the due date of project completion due to avoid last minute hassle i would also share the same work with my boss to keep him aware about the project and its continuity i am prepared mentally to accept new challenges from my boss and also take support from my colleagues for last minute tasks that can take significant amounts of time and attention i would let go my colleague to enjoy and relax after work however , i would surely attend a networking meeting with one of our largest clients to maintain trust , faith , and future business relations although it 's been a long day at work , i would still feel energetic and enthusiastic in front of our clients so that the meeting goes smoothly and fully conversed both end i would also inform my boss about the meeting conversation i would surely discuss the negative feedback with higher management so that it does not affect my annual appraisal and bonus as i believe the negative feedback is not true , i would fight for my rights and wo n't let go my hard work in vain i would also take help from the experienced colleagues so that the dispute gets resolved soon i would also ensure the negative feedback from my manager will not affect my work for the rest of the day month i will keep myself optimistic , positive , alert , and focused i would surely be the first person to involve on the project as i love to love to visit europe and also love to know more about european countries culture this project would be very much interested and enjoyable as i also love to know history of norway even though if i do n't get a chance to travel to norway , it would be a remembering and amazing experience for me to work on this project
i would tell my boss that he should go by seniority as to who would get the week off when i make vacation plans i want to stick to them , it would be very difficult to change my plans once i have made them , i do realize that the other person might have seniority over mei would start to work on the project right away , i would rather have the peace of mind of knowing i am ahead of the game if something should come up that i have to work on other things i would know i have some work done towards the projecti would go to the meeting , it is important to stay in touch with my clients , i think i would be able to handle myself on my owni would question my manager about the situation , i would ask for proof that what he is saying is true , i would explain that i take my work seriously and that he should too i would find this to be boring , i am not really interested in learning of other peoples cultures , i might have been interested if there was the chance to go to norway but that did n't present itself , it would n't be bad to travel for work
depending on the circumstances and if i had plans that could be moved , i might just let my colleague take the week without any protest if that was the case however i would want first choice for the next year i would push the project to near completion so that i could still finish in time even if given additional work i would then contact my manager to let them know that i had capacity for additional work i would prefer not to go because i do not like attending events where i do not know anybody so , if i could not convince my colleague to go i would not attend i would try to take the feedback and use the parts that i felt would be beneficial i would then make it a point to emphasize to my manager the portions of the feedback that i took and implemented i would enjoy this experience as learning some aspects of norway would be enjoyable and show that i was engaged the only bad part would be having to travel but it looks like that is not a requirement
most likely i would forfeit that vacation time and reschedule for another time it might be difficult if plans and reservations were made i would try to compromise if at all possible and discuss the matter with my co worker and office manager i would make make this project a priority and try to finish it early if my boss had other tasks for me to do , i would see if it 's at all possible to delegate the easier ones to my co workers i would also work overtime if necessary to complete the project i would still go to the meeting so i could meet the clients i would explain that my colleague was not feeling up to attending the meeting , but that i was very interested in meeting them and getting some feedback from them i think it would be an important meeting as it is one of our largest clients i would try to establish a rapport to encourage positive communications in the future i would probable first react a little on the defensive side as that is human nature i would find out exactly what i needed to work on and what i could do to improve my performance and avoid the same situation in the future i might also ask my manager to give me a chance to improve and ask for some suggestions and feedback after i 've had some time to work on it depending on the situation , i may ask co workers for their opinions on whatever it was that i was not doing well at i would enjoy learning about norway and take the research seriously i might even ask if a trip there is possible i find other cultures , countries and customs very interesting i think it would also be beneficial to the company to understand how the clients think and their point of view
i would try to explain the nature of my vacation if i had ordered tickets already , i may have to have continued discussion with my boss it is possible that i could work out some sort of deal regarding trading current vacation days for additional days in the future furthermore , it may be beneficial to contact the hr department i would begin working on the project right away therefore , if i were assigned a last minute project , i could put it on hold but after some progress therefore , it may be beneficial to contact the subject matter experts early on in case i would need any assistance finally , i would do my best to talk with my boss about any potential upcoming projects i would have to consider many variables before making my decision however , it may be beneficial to go to the meeting , seeing that i may be the only representative from my work in attendance furthermore , the networking meeting may even have food drinks to help the time go by faster i may try to tell these reasons to my co worker in order to persuade them to come but even if they would n't go , i would probably end up going myself i would feel pretty bad about the situation i may try to schedule a follow up meeting with my manager in order to explain my case furthermore , i may gather information with regards to my work accomplishments in order to help my case if my manager was unmoving , i may begin to look for other opportunities \( depending on the relationship \) i would definitely find this experience enjoyable i really like learning about new places and cultures i think it would be fun to try and assist another individual learn about my company and my culture it may be fun to create a relationship friendship going forward with this new client
i would see if i am able to change my vacation plans to demonstrate that i am a team player if the plans cannot be changed , i will attempt to talk to my colleague and supervisor and see if we can do anything to change the situation finally , i would question who submitted the request first and who has more seniority if my colleague submitted first , then i would feel obligated to allow them to have the week i would start working on the project immediately and see if i can complete it before the due date if i am able to complete it soon , it will give me some time to look over it and possibly come up with additional ideas it will also allow me to continue to work on other projects as they come up i would attend for a short time , if i do n't already have another commitment it is important to get to know the clients , even if i do not already know anyone there it would give me the opportunity to possibly impress the client and improve my work circumstances i would ask to set up a meeting with my manager to discuss the issue further prior to the meeting , i would go over the information provided and compile supporting information that demonstrates why i feel that the feedback was inaccurate then i would meet with my manager and see if i can improve his or her outlook on the situation i would find this experience very enjoyable i always enjoy learning about other countries and other cultures it would give me an opportunity to demonstrate my willingness to learn new things as well
i would just shift my week of vacation to the next week over it 's the easiest path with the least amount of resistance it also avoids any workplace conflict , even though i feel i'm giving in i would finish my work with as much time before the due date as possible i would try and take into account my boss 's habit of adding difficult tasks and try and plan out time for it if i finish the easier parts quickly and efficiently , i wo n't be as stressed when surprises come my way i would ask my colleague to go i would present them with a list of all the pros of going to it , letting them know that while we were both tired , it would help make our lives easier in the long term with them there , it would be easier to introduce myself and network with others i would at first try arguing with my manager i would look for any documentation to support my argument if necessary , i will push my argument over my manager 's head , making sure to document everything i would find this experience pretty enjoyable i would get to learn about a new culture it also helps improve my general work life experience
i would change my vacation to a different week it would not be a burden on me also , it would look good to my supervisor that i was a cooperative employee i would use that opportunity to get in good with my supervisor and leverage my cooperative attitude to get future things , like raises , promotions , etc i would begin work on the project immediately this would give me the confidence that if my boss did add additional non project related tasks , i could finish the project on time also , by starting the project early , it would give me a chance to go over it , review it and perfect it i would go because it 's an opportunity to meet new people , but especially it will show one of our largest clients that i'm an employee who cares enough to put in extra effort it is also a chance to show any of my companies senior managers i'm eager it could also be valuable in the future to advance my career with , perhaps , another company it 's outrageous to get an unfair review and i would be angry i would gather the facts and supporting evidence from co workers to support me i would than go to my manager and request he review the situation and ask for him to change his mind if he refused , i would bring the matter to the attention of his boss i would find it very enjoyable i love the idea of learning about new cultures and people also , it would put me in a position to become involved in other projects with additional clients from norway i could even get to travel on the company dime there some day
i would ask my wife if she had already planned a trip or purchased something for that week i would be willing to be flexible unless the trip was related to her chemotherapy , in which case i would take the time of as medical leave i would set daily and weekly goals for how much i needed to complete to finish the project on time with no last minute rush i would also allow extra time for other projects that might be assigned during the two week period if possible , i would finish the main project early i would not go to the meeting i would go home and spend time with family any required meetings need to be during work hours or scheduled very far in advance if my employer had a problem with me putting family first , i would start looking for anther job and immediately give notice that i am leaving that company i would talk to my manager privately to clarify the situation and what my expectations and contributions have been if the disagreement could not be resolved , i would accept what my manager says but document everything i did very well in case i need proof in the future if this sort of event was habitual , i would start looking for a different position with another manageras long as the project did not involve strange hours , i would volunteer i would enjoy learning the language , up to a point , and interacting with the people from norway as long as i did not have to adjust to their time zone i would not want to travel , although i am sure norway is beautiful
i would agree to change my vacation plans unless i had already booked the itinerary , which in that case i would let both him and my supervisor know this , with proof if my itinerary was not booked yet , and nothing had been prearranged , then i would change my vacation week however , i would request that moving forward , there be better polices in place regarding pto for instance , those with seniority have priority or possibly a first come , first serve policy i would work on the project every day until completion i would also let my supervisor know that , if given last minute tasks , i can work on them to a point , but my main goal is to complete the project i believe that honesty and transparency is best in the workplace if my supervisor is practical , he she would understand and perhaps delegate the smaller tasks to a coworker i would most likely not go either it was a long day at work and i am probably tired , which means that i would not be putting my best face forward also , the invite was last minute and i ca n't be expected to drop whatever plans i had made previously lastly , i would not feel comfortable attending alone i would let my manager know why i believe the feedback to be inaccurate , with data to prove this if possible if he she is not willing to listen , i would approach hr with the situation if it is a reputable company , there should be mediation practices in place for these types of situations it would be unfair for my work to be not be counted fairly i would find this experience to be enjoyable as i like learning about other cultures i would also like this opportunity so that i may add this to my resume for career enhancement i would also ask how this project would interfere with work as well i would not like to be a part of the project if it is on personal time and not compensated
i would speak with the coworker to see why he was unwilling to change his plans if it was for a legitimate reason , such as tickets he could not change or get a refund for , i would examine my own travel plans and see if there was any room to change them from there , i would make my decision i would try to get it done as soon as possible expecting a last minute task , i would hope to get as much done as possible on the project that way , i would put myself in a good position to finish the project on time i would still attend i would expect that a few other people there would not know anyone prior a networking meeting is usually with people who don t know each other i would obviously feel agitated i would arrange a time to speak with the manager as soon as possible hopefully then , we could sort out what the issue was i would absolutely find this enjoyable i would volunteer to do so i would also hope that some travel would be involved
i would like to change my vacation plan because one person should compromise with other to avoid problem in workplace so i change my opinion and re plan the vacation i would schedule time to complete the work this makes me to work in order and complete the work i will aware with the last tasks and complete with full effort i would like to go and attend the meeting even though it is new place and new members i will go there this makes me to feel more confident attending meeting may give some experience to me i would argue with my manager and tell my opinions if he not understand i will take this problem to higher officials i convince them to accept my opinions and surely i always stand in my opinion i would feel this experience as enjoyable and more interesting i like to learn different cultures from different countries it leads to know the traditional values of many countries
i would point out that since we are on an equal footing , my coworker has no more \( or less \) right to the week off than me unless i absolutely needed the week , i 'd probably give in , but insist on some sort of compensation most likely , that the next time this situation arose , i 'd get preference i would talk to my boss and tell them how tight my workload is i would say something like , look , i'm going to find a way to get this done my only request is that i not be given any extra projects between now and then , because i'm already stretched i would probably feel obliged to go , even though i would n't want to it would look bad if nobody represented our company at the meeting , so i 'd go i 'd tell my colleague that he she owed me one if possible , i 'd ask for a meeting so that i could present my side of things if i still felt that i was being treated unfairly , i 'd probably consider looking for another job i 'd love to do that i find norway , and scandinavia in general , very interesting i like their form of government and how they take care of each other plus , i'm a generally curious person
i would take a different week off i am usually quite flexible when requesting time off i do understand business needs therefore , i would just take a different week off i would get started on the project as quickly as possible i would also try to finish the project as soon as possible , expecting my boss to give me last minute task if i do n't receive any last minute task , i would just go over the project details again , correcting possible errors i would go to the networking meeting alone large clients are very important i do n't need to know people personally at meetings , to feel comfortable besides , it would give me a chance to get to know other people i would feel disappointed , but i would expect some negative feedback some of the time , even when i have done a good job i would continue doing my job , as well as possible however , i would also look for other opportunities the situation would not be enjoyable or boring i would be okay with it however , i would n't love the situation , since i prefer to focus on my usual work , which i know how to do
i would consider which of us has plans that are the most difficult to change if my time off was just an arbitrary week , i would not make an issue of it if for example i had expensive tickets already booked , i would go to battle for my week ! if i have plenty of time , i would get started right away knowing that my boss has a tendency to dump last minute tasks on me and that you never know when someone will call out and change your workload , it 's best to get started right away i would n't relax until at least 3 4 of the project was done i would go if it is one of our largest clients it would be my job to make sure that they are aware that i am present and representing my company it 's also taking one for the team maybe my colleague can attend the next event i do n't want to attend ! i would fight the urge to argue my side in order to hear my boss' opinion in its entirety then i would firmly disagree and state my viewpoint i would also try to work with my boss to see what could be happening to give her such an opinion of me maybe there is a lack of communication that can be resolved i would find it enjoyable learning about other countries and cultures is like traveling and if you ever do travel there you may have already gained valuable insight into that culture
i would let them have their time and pick another time i can almost always change my plans , so it is not a big problem i would rather get along than fight with someone so it really would not be a problem i would start the project right away i would much rather get done early than be stressing at the last minute that would give me time to do whatever else the boss needs but i would still get it done if need be , i would stay later to finish it there is no way i would go i am an introvert so if my colleague is n't going , then neither am i ! that would be torture to me , to have to make small talk with strangers not for me ! ! i would be super upset and try to get proof that the feedback was n't accurate i would respectfully let her know that i did not agree i would bring as much proof as i could i would try to talk to her about it to get more details on why she thinks the way she does i would find it super enjoyable i would love to learn about new countries and their ways of doing things ! it would be even better if i could travel there !
i would say we needed to be fair on this issue and have a toss up something where we both have a chance to get time off in a equally fair way it would not be ethical for one person just to say , i will not change i would get started early and feel confident that all was done well i would make sure there was additional time put aside for if and when the boss would give me last minute tasks to do i would still go i would not need anyone to help me in networking i know how to do that myself i would do a good job with everyone that attended i would ask for a meeting so we can discuss this situation fairly i would want to go over the reasons for this and state what is true and untrue it would be important for both of us to see the truth of this i would find that very interesting i would love to take on that project i would work very hard and make it an interesting and rewarding work project
i would change my vacation plans if i had something very important that i had planned to take vacation time for a child 's wedding or an anniversary trip i would first discuss this with my colleague and if that person was unreasonable i would take it up with my supervisor barring some very important event though this would not be a big deal to cede to my colleague 's wishes and keep things running smoothly at work i would work on the project with the goal of getting it done early my logic would be that with my luck if i waited my boss would swamp me with several last minute tasks and the project would suffer if i complete the project early i have time to revise it completing the project early would also help me keep my stress levels down i would go to the meeting anyway i would introduce myself and reference my colleague 's name when doing so i value my job and the words networking and largest client say to me that it is a must attend meeting i would inform my colleague of my intentions and ask what excuse i should offer for their absence hoping that would convince my colleague to attend i would feel hurt and confused because i know i always try to do my best and to do things the way the company wants things done i would wait a day or so so the hurt feelings would n't be so blatantly displayed on my sleeve during that time i would look into the matter and see what my manager was referring to i would then approach them with the materials in hand and ask for a further explanation so the situation did n't keep happening and i could continue on with confidence in my work quality i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i enjoy connecting with people and learning new things i am also part norwegian so i could learn something about my ancestors culture as well i would probably knock people over jumping to my feet with my hand in the air saying me , me , pick me
i would establish an agreement with my colleague , where the person who most needs to go on vacation on that date will be the one who takes the vacations , if in hypothetical case it is my colleague , i will agree to change my vacation plans i will make the decision to advance as much as i can of the project as long as my boss does not assign me new activities , in order to avoid accumulating work that would prevent the project from being completed i would like to attend the work meeting , because i do not want to miss the opportunity to meet my best client , as this would be of great benefit for my work , where new projects could be proposed i would like to talk seriously with my manager to clarify his answer , as well as i would like to express what i think about his decision i would like to be a volunteer in the project because i like to know and interact with other cultures , because they allow me to accumulate experience , greater capacity for understanding , empathy and better relationships with others , as well as broaden my perspectives and generates a more positive view of life
i would state to my boss that i put in the request first i would also say that i have plane reservations i ca n't change them as my tickets are non refundable if i did n't have reservations tickets , then maybe i could change my time off i would begin working on this project starting now and not wait until the last minute i would complete as much as i can leading up to the due date if i have to work overtime due to extra work my boss has given me , then i will have to put in extra time i would also keep my boss informed of my progress i would have to attend the meeting even though i know no one because of who the client is i will go , listen , participate and leave after the meeting i will report about the meeting the next business day i feel as if i need to prove myself and also to dispute what my manager said i will need to come up with proof to dispute my manager 's claims i would put it all in writing and ensure this ends up in my personnel file i would hope my manager is open to what i have to say i would find the experience enlightening and treat it like a learning mission i would be able to understand and relate to the client in ways i might not have before i believe this could possibly bring more deals to my company from this client
i would likely choose another date and tell my colleague that the next vacation selection is mine i would let them have this date and then i would ask for the christmas holiday week between christmas and new years off there are many important and desirable dates for vacation so unless i had some very important function i needed to do at the specific time i originally requested i would change and have first dibs on the next selection i would get the project done as soon as possible so that i was prepared for the additional work my boss may assign me i may even work late a time or two to be finished ahead of time because my past experience is that i am assigned more work last minute i would work to be prepared i would go to the network meeting i cant use my colleague as a crutch its time i branch out and make new connections i can talk to all kinds of people and this would be a good opportunity to network and become known for my talents aside from my colleague i would be upset and frustrated i would take some time to review the feedback and think about what was said ans how they could perceive my work in that manner then i would approach my boss and ask for time to discuss the issues i would present my information about why i think my work was more positive than he rated i would offer documentation or backup as to why and then also acknowledge where iicould have done better it could be my boss didnt get the full scope of my work and isnt truly aware of everything i have done well i would enjoy this experience and would gladly learn all i can about norway i would even go so far as to learn some of the most common phrases and how to properly acknowledge people i think it would be a great experience to learn about this different culture
i would determine how important my vacation was to me if it was just relaxing at home , i would be a lot more willing to change my vacation week if it was planned out far in advance with money already put down i would be much less likely to change my plans it would also depend on their plans , and how difficult they would be to change the date on i would ask the supervisor who requested off first , because whoever asked first should get it i would be very stressed i would probably put most of my effort in to complete long the new tasks i would probably end up working early or late on the new tasks , depending how urgent they were i would probably rush through the new tasks too i would probably go although it would depend on my husband too , especially if was home with out son it would be unfair of me to decide 100 on my own i would talk to my boss about it first if hat didn t work , i would gather any proof i had that their feedback was wrong , and then go to hr if that didn t work , i would try to go to my boss boss i would find it enjoyable i think learning about a new culture would be a lot of fun , especially if no travel was required although i would be open to travel too , especially if i d already learned about the culture and country
i change i do n't care i'm not there to be a little jerk as long as i still get the vacation it does n't seem like a big issuei do n't know this is such a weird in particular instant i would need more information on the work i 've been given and how much and wheni'm just go just like with every question you can ask me life is hard sometimes you just do what you have to do it 's not the end of the world and this thing really needs to pay moreand say something nip it in the bud if you do n't say anything and defend yourself in situations like these there 's nowhere to go but downany chance to learn something sounds like fun i mean out of all the jobs i could possibly come off as boring i do n't see why this would be one of them there are a lot worst jobs in the world
i would feel obligated to move my vacation but also feel resentful i would hopefully not have purchased tickets already i think if i did i would also them refuse to move i would try to get everything done as quickly as possible that way i would have extra time for the last minuet projects i would also ask about some often i would just go anyway you can always make friends these events are meant for making friends with people anyway i would first discuss the situation with my manager i would then escalate the issue if i had some sort of proof if i didnt have proof i would probably do nothing i would enjoy this a lot i love traveling , and travel in the nordics a lot i would be perfect for this
i would be disappointed about the issue and try to convince my colleague why i really need this vacation time however , if that is not possible then i would sacrifice my vacation and allow the other person to go being single i can always find another time to vacation , but i would make it known to the other person that i will allow them to go and ask if the courtesy can be returned if the problem arises again i would advise my boss of my upcoming deadline and ask that if last minute projects arise can another person assist i will offer to assist the individual should the need help with the task upon completion of my project , i would be willing to take over the task to completion i would still go to the event this will be an opportunity for me to get to know others within the network going would provide great contacts for me and build my network if i attend without my colleagues it will teach me how to better my skills in communicating with others i see this interruption as a plus for me as much s i believe the feedback is not accurate i would try to understand why my manager feels that way i would also look at trying to find a mentor within the company that could better assist me in the areas i am lacking i want to remain a competitive individual within the company so harsh feedback can help motivate me in changing my managers perspective of the issue if , losing a bonus on the line also then i am really more inclined to get to the bottom of the problem i would definitely take up the offer even though it may not involve travel it is still by far a learning experience that i can use in the future the opportunity can open doors in other areas i may be interested in to me , this experience would be enjoyable
i would ask the supervisor who had requested the week off first if it was me , then i would stay firm in my request and apologize to my colleague , but explain that my plans are also important to me i would be firm even if my plans were somewhat flexible , because i believe it 's important to stand up for fair and objective treatment in the workplace , even in small matters if my colleague had requested first , then i would change my plans , and also ask my colleague if they would remember this favor in future \( never hurts to have people owe you a favor , and of course if my colleague was wise enough to ask me the same in the reverse situation , i would remember it \) i would make a schedule of smaller deadlines that i expect to achieve , and discuss it with my boss to be sure that he or she is aware that i do have work to fill my time , and may not necessarily be available last minute for poorly planned side tasks i would still try to work quickly and remain ahead of my self imposed deadlines , so that if other tasks did come up , i could still complete everything on time while making sure my boss is aware that their planning was not ideal i would ask the colleague if they are willing to go for only a short time , with both of us being honest with the client that we ca n't stay long but did n't want to miss out completely if they still do n't want to go , i would do the same but alone make a short appearance \( maybe a shot of espresso first for energy \) , then go home and rest i would gather evidence from my work portfolio and any contrasting feedback i have from clients and colleagues , possibly requesting the latter from my closest contacts to bolster my case i would then schedule a meeting \( soon \) with my manager and say that i have taken the feedback under consideration , but that i disagree somewhat with the overall assessment for these reasons , then present my evidence if the manager does not enter into a reasonable discussion on the subject , i would start looking for a transfer or a different job i would find this pretty exciting , especially if there might be an opportunity for travel international travel is my main hobby and i love learning about and especially experiencing different cultures
before anything , i would be willing to concede if my colleague had asked before me and would expect the same from them if i asked first but did n't have anything planned , i would give my colleague that week if i did have plans \( family event wedding baby \) , i would explain how important this event was to me and would explain why i could n't give it up i would try to get ahead of schedule with the project in order to create time for unexpected tasks i would intentionally schedule time \( based on prior experiences \) near the due date for the potential added workload i would also add time near the due date for final touches and reviews first and foremost , i would try to convince my colleague to go with me networking is very important for the company and personal career growth i would be nervous and reluctant but would ultimately decide to go i would ask my manager for constructive criticism and insight as to why they thought my work was n't up to par if i came to the realization that there was merit behind the assessment , i would try to rectify the situation regardless of whether it ended up being true or not , i would do my best to learn from the situation i would find this experience enjoyable i would be nervous about the amount of information i had to learn and in what time period i would find this personally enjoyable because i have always been curious about other counties and cultures
i would take a different vacation week this is because i would not want to cause a problem at work it 's not worth causing the conflict this would also maybe make them offer a favor to me i would get started on it immediately i would plan out what is needed to get done then i would start on it right away my goal would be to be done as early as possible i would probably stay at home too unless i was higher up in company or a salesperson this would allow me to make more money or move up in company otherwise no big deal i would ask to have a re review in a 2 months i would also keep track of what i have been doing as proof then if i had another negative review i would ask for documentation i would then go to hr if not rectified i would find it great i am scandinavian blood so this is easy i would love to travel there if possible
i would tell my coworker to please go by whoever put their request in first if i put in m y vacation request first i would ask that my supervisor honor my request and tell my coworker that their request is denied it is unfair to make me change my plans i would start on the project early it is bad to procrastinate anyway , and i need to practice good work habits i would like to handle less stress at the end and just do it piece by piece i would go anyway and meet new people if anything i will hand out all my business cards and hopefully be considered for more projects later on i will try to convince my coworker to go though i do n't want to create a big issue , but i would request a sit down with my manager and ask to discuss the feedback he is giving me i believe in getting explanations of what i'm doing wrong i would want a resolution of where the misunderstanding wasi would find this to be a fun experience as i love to learn about new cultures i would try to make myself an expert on the country i would want the client to see that i have done my research
it would depend on how serious my plans were if i were going on vacation for example and i already had my tickets purchased for whatever i was going to , i would n't budge and say i need that week now if i just wanted time off then i would take a different week off that year i would speak with my boss and let him know that i have a heavy workload and ask that he does n't give me any extra projects until i had finished if he still had to give me something then i would ask if i could work overtime if i ca n't do that , then i guess just work extra hard i most likely would n't go , but then again if i could network with people i do n't see that as a bad thing depending on how nice the client is and the people there i might go and just not say anything about my colleague not wanting to come if they are n't so nice then i would claim i'm sick or have other plans i would speak to my manager and explain to them why i feel the negative feedback is n't justified i would try and have them look at all sides and see if i can convince them if that does n't work i may go above my boss , go to whoever is above them and explain the situation i personally would find this experience enjoyable i love traveling and going to new places , and if i got paid for it that would be a bonus in my opinion now if the travel expenses were n't paid for , or i did n't get paid i may not go it depends on the situation
i would change my plans if that is possible at the very least discuss it with my colleague usually vacations are pretty flexible i would get the project done as soon as possible even though it seems like a relatively easy task , you should n't put it by the wayside because you do n't know what else could come up first in first out i would still go their behavior is not a reflection of you especially when it comes to networking , you have to go and put yourself out there that confidence will only help i would calmly and professionally explain my opinion if my manager seems receptive see if there is anything i can do to fix the negative feedback it always a good idea to acknowledge mistakes and strive to do better i would find this boring i would want to be there and experience the culture first hand that is how passion about the subject is created experience
i would change my vacation days , because i feel like i would be owed one in the future it would also make me look better to the employer that i yielded to another coworker 's needs i would do what i can to finish it up i would n't rush through it , but i would try to finish it before the two weeks that way , if the boss drops any last minute tasks , i have nothing to distract me from them i would go without them i would n't need them the meeting is all about networking with the client and potential clients anyway i would ask the manager to have a meeting , and i would explain , in detail , just why i disagreed with the feedback i would be staunch , but not overbearing , and i would try to make a concession of some sort i would find it a lot of fun i love learning about cultures anyway , and traveling would be a bonus it 's absolutely up my alley and i would not consider this a burden , but an opportunity
i would be happy to change my plans while it might not be convenient , it is n't really a big deal , and my turn will come around again in the future i 'd be happy to switch weeks knowing the boss , i would do my best to get my project done the sooner it is finished , the better i would be able to respond to his last minute requests i 'd go to the meeting even if i did n't know anyone , it would be a great place to meet new people i would n't be afraid to meet the client alone at the party i would n't be happy i 'd wait a day or two until i was calm then i would go and discuss the review , first asking questions and then making my points absolutely enjoyable i 'd happy volunteer to go to norway if it were needed that would be a grand adventure
i would talk to my colleague first and see what the plans were for the vacation and how flexible they are if the other person had plans that were depending on pre paid items , i would change my plans i think that i could be more flexible if they really needed that week we could find a win win situation i would work on the project right away and not take the chance that my boss would give me something at the last minute i like to start projects well ahead of time , so this would not be a problem for me i would aim to be far along in the project a week ahead to make sure that i could finish without any stress i would go to the networking meeting even if my colleague decided not to go i do n't have a problem with not knowing people when i go to this type of function i would look forward to meeting new people i would expect to gather information that would be useful for me in the future i would first reconsider my perception of the feedback there may , if fact , be some truth to my managers view i would try to understand their point of view and see if they have all the information if they are basing it on information that is correct , i would address how i would make the situation right i would find it very enjoyable to learn something new i think that you need to learn new things as often as you can it would be a challenge to learn about the culture of the new client
i would see which of the two of us had seniority , then ask my supervisor to consider honoring the person with the longest seniority in addition , i would try to accommodate the other person if it ca n't be worked out by seniority i would do my best to complete the project well before the deadline in the event my boss hits me with last minute issues , i be better prepared i would go anyway , as i feel one of the two of us should attend this is a large client to our company , and i would not want it to appear as though this client is not important enough for someone in my company to make an effort , or appearance i would feel slighted , and possibly angry about this if after doing some looking at myself to determine if this feedback was warranted if i believe it to be unwarranted , i would have a conversation directly with my manager , in the hope of getting a positive written feedback report i would find this experience enjoyable i think it would be good to learn some things about the culture of another country i would find it interesting
i would evaluate the option of rescheduling my vacation to ease the stress then i would also ask my coworker to do the same we should discuss the nature of our vacations and how convenient or inconvenient it would be for either of us to reschedule ultimately , i would probably be the one to reschedule i understand the nature of my job making sure i keep my schedule clear and stay ahead of tasks will help me achieve my goals i will ask my supervisor to please give me adequate notice for any additional workload i would explain the benefit of the both of us attending then i would offer to drive us there in addition , i would offer to take my coworker home after to help relieve pressure and to carpool for convenience i am not happy about this situation feeling inferior or wrongly criticized is helpless i want a chance to be heard i would find this enjoyable the opportunity to learn about a different culture is exciting with these skills , i should be able to impress our new client
i would change my plans to the week after i would demonstrate that i m a team player by doing this it should n't make a difference if i move my vacation by a week as long as i can change my plans without paying anything extra i would get the project done early this could free me up in case last minute projects come my way if nothing extra lands on my desk , i can use the time to help others or to pursue other projects i would still go i need to branch out and make contacts to further my career these contacts could be very useful in the future i would write down what i a good job i did i would ask for a meeting with the manager to plead my case and why the feedback was wrong if the manager refuses to hear me out , i would go to someone higher up i would enjoy it i think other cultures are fascinating i think it would make the client interactions more successful and comfortable by doing this
i would not give in either if i gave in , my colleague might think that i am weak and run over me in the future i would suggest that we either split up the days , or come to some sort of other compromise i would try my best to complete the project that is due in 2 weeks while my workload it light since my boss gives last minute tasks , i would hate to take the risk of not finishing the project it just would n't make sense for me to procrastinate in a situation such as this i would still go to the networking meeting if my co worker decided not to go i would just make sure that i had a couple of drinks before going so that i would be comfortable opening up to people i may not know i would not force my colleague who is tired , and it may allow me to meet more people without my colleague being there i would be extremely upset about this situation my reputation is on the line here i would ask for my manager to do a bit more investigating before carrying out any consequences i would find the experience boring because i do n't know much about norway , but am always interested in learning new things it would keep me busy as well hopefully , i will also get to meet new people
i would try to make a deal with my co worker i would say that i would give it up if they would give me something in return i would also ask who scheduled it first i would try ot convince my supervisor to let us both have it i would try to get as much of the project done ahead of time as possible so that i would n't be stressed out at the last minute i would try to check with the boss ahead of time to avoid having something assigned to me last minute i would try to finish the project early i would weigh the pros and cons of not going i would consider how going or not going would effect my career if i wanted to go and my co worker did n't , i would try to find someone else to go with me i would feel angry and anxious i would reflect on what the manager says if i still find it to be untrue i would talk to them about it to see if it could be changed i might ask for extra feedback from other co workers i would try to see if i could fix it before the bonus is handed out i would find this experience enjoyable i enjoy learning about new cultures and countries it seems like it would be a break from my usual routine
i would try to change my plans to the week before or the week after the desired dates if my colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans , i would have to assume that there is a reason \( e g , nonrefundable plane tickets , others involved \) in my opinion , it is not worth losing the friendship of coworkers over something that can be changed i would start working on the project a little each day starting two weeks prior i would plan to be done a couple days in advance of the due date that way if there were any last minute tasks that my boss assigned , i would't feel rushed to complete the project initially assigned this would ensure that i was able to spend an appropriate amount of time on the project i would suck it up and go the fact that my coworker is n't going would make me feel even more obligated to represent work is always going to involve obligations that are difficult , awkward or uncomfortable it 's important , though , to put yourself out there and network i would ask for examples of situations where i did n't perform up to expectations if he she could give me examples , i would try to improve in those areas if she could n't , i would fight it i would n't want to face consequences that were a result of something that did n't actually happen if i had to go above her head \( to her supervisor \) , i would do that in this situation i would find this experience enjoyable i am proud of our country and our history , so teaching someone about it would be very rewarding , in my opinion i also like taking on new tasks and this would be something that i 've never done
i would not be willing to switch if i got my request in on time and was first if i requested second i might be willing to switch i would probably try to negotiate with my colleague and see whose plans might already have a fiscal commitment or any other specific details of the vacation if i were forced to under threat of say losing my job , i would stay but if not , i would probably leave anyway especially if this was a pre planned trip that i had already committed a substantial amount of money into i would approach this job aggressively you ca n't be over prepared when it comes to projects being behind is not good for the job start on it early , and finish it as early as possible that way you have plenty of time for any changes or problems that may occur with the project i probably would not go i tend not to be comfortable in groups of new people i have never met it would be fairly uncomfortable in this type of situation , especially considering it was a professional setting and not a social relaxing setting if i mess up a professional setting it could have detrimental effects on my job , but in a social relaxing one , it does n't effect my livelihood that much i would be upset i do n't like knowing that i did n't do a good job morally there is an issue for being paid a substantial salary and just doing a poor job at something that can be mission critical , secondly , anyone with any sort of pride in their type of work should be upset at negative feedback especially considering it might affect your own wallet i would love to go to norway i love experiencing new cultures , foods , and people i 've been to sweden once almost 15 years ago and love scandinavian culture i want to go back despite the fact it would be a business trip i would still find a way to carve out some time and visit sites , and do local activities
i would determine who had the vacation on the books first if i had it first , i would take my vacation when i wanted to , however if the colleague had their vacation on the books first , i would allow them to take it it highly depends on my relationship with the colleague and who had the projected vacation first i would handle this project by getting it done before the due date that way , if the boss gives me last minute tasks to complete , i wo n't go overdue on the timeline of the project that i have been given that said , finishing a project before it 's due often gives you praise from the boss because you worked fast and diligently to complete it before it was due i would go anyway going to networking meetings is a great way to expand your sphere of influence , and you may make vital contacts that you can use in the future when completing projects for the clients additionally , you should n't go to a networking meeting if your colleague is going , as you should be branching out and meeting new people i would take the managers information and ask questions about negative feedback in what ways can you improve by using the information that was given \? a feedback should be a two way street and include input from both sides , so i would make sure that i come away from the feedback session with the most information that i could i would find this experience enjoyable , as my lineage takes me back to norway , any excuse to learn about the country and culture is a plus additionally , knowing about the country and culture will help when dealing with the clients from that country , and allow you to have a better rapport with them as business continues
i would see who requested the vacation first if it were me , i would request the other person change their week if it was the other person , i would change my plans if we could n't come to an agreement , i would make the supervisor decide it should n't be up to me to make the decision on who does what the co worker seems unreasonable to me i would work on the project early and try to get as much done as possible well before the due date that way , if my supervisor throws a project at me , i could be able to manage both projects without much trouble if time became too tight even with my plan , i would request my boss hold off on the other task until my main project is completed my boss should know that i have an important project due and should n't be handing off last minute projects that is not good leadership i would probably go even if my coworker did n't i might try to persuade my coworker to go , even if only for a short time however , i would still try to go regardless i'm a shy person , so not knowing anyone would be tough for me however , since this is a major client , i know it is important to at least make an appearance so they know i care about them i would confront my manager about the negative feedback since i do n't think it is true , i would gather reasons i think my manager is wrong and ask them why they gave the feedback they did if my manager could not give adequate reasons or i think they have nefarious alternative ideas , i would contemplate taking the issue to hr or to my manager 's boss if i 've been accused of something that is n't true , and it may cause major consequences , i'm not going to just accept it i would find the experience enjoyable i am interested in other cultures and would like to know more about norwegian culture , their norms , the country , and how the people are i think it would make the project more interesting , while also broadening my knowledge about other cultures it would be disappointing to not get to travel despite getting to learn about the country , but i would get over that
i would not be willing to change my vacation time unless it was absolutely necessary vacations in my family take a lot of time to plan and i would not be willing to disrupt our plans additionally , i would suggest to my supervisor to give it to the person who put in the time first , which probably would be me since i planned this trip so early i would start the project as soon as possible knowing how unpredictable my boss is , i would try to get as much done so i would not have to make this a last minute rush job also , working on the project earlier gives me more time to make revisions and make the project as great as possible i would still go to the meeting although i would not know anyone there , it is important for me to be there because my client expects it also , it would look good to my boss and show how hardworking and willing i am i would not be happy about the situation i would ask a few colleagues if they feel that the feedback was correct if they do i would try to work hard to change if not , i may go above my manager and speak about the unfairness , or i may drop it because money is involved i would find the experience enjoyable i am very interested in other cultures and this would provide me the opportunity to learn on my company 's dime also this would make me look good to my bosses
my actions would be dependant on my vacation plans if these were non refundable , important and planned way in advance arrangements , i would find a way to negotiate with my colleague \( s \) is there anything i can offer him to have him work with me \? could my other colleagues be talked into picking up extra hours that work \? if my plans were n't already set , then i 'd make a show of taking one for the team and make sure my colleague knew that i was making a sacrifice for him i would use my past experiences with my boss to realize that i had to plan ahead this would mean factoring in extra work into my project planning i would basically pretend my project due date was closer than it really is and tackle it right away , updating my boss as i went so i could have extra time for last minute tasks my social anxiety makes this easy to answer i would not go because i 'd probably be an awkward mess however , i know that i absolutely should go as it would be a great networking opportunity i would feel very frustrated and probably afraid of the consequences , not just about something tangible like losing a bonus , but the hit my reputation would be taking i would gather as much evidence as i could on the matter i would then take it to my manager and try and reason with them as to why they should reconsider their feedback if the matter was pretty serious and i could not get them to listen to me , i would consider the pros and cons of going above their heads depending on my current duties at work , this deal would probably be incredibly enjoyable the break from things to learn about something new \( especially on company time \) sounds awesome doubly so if the project includes traveling to norway if anything , it adds something fun to incorporate into my resume
i would choose another date for my vacation i would try to be as flexible as possible so that no hard feelings would develop over the situation in my opinion , vacations are pretty flexible i would start on the project right away and try to complete it i would not want to take a chance that i would run out of time to complete the project i would want plenty of time to do my vey best on the project i would go to the networking meeting regardless of whether my colleague could go or not networking meetings are a fantastic way to meet new contacts and learn about new opportunities i would not mind if i did not know anyone there , i would meet people right away i would first talk to my manager and explain that i do not agree with the feedback if my manager did not agree to amend the feedback i would have to ask to speak to someone over him to explain the situation and defend myself since the feedback could carry real consequences it would be imperative that i speak up i would find this opportunity to be a fantastic experience i would jump at the chance to be involved in this project the opportunity to work with a client in norway would be so interesting
i would not budge my fellow worker 's vacation needs are no more important than mine i 'd leave it to management to make the decision as to who needs to change their plans i would work double time to get the project finished before not when it was due that way i 'd avoid being thrown off base by last minute tasks and it would make me look good to be finished early i would try to talk my colleague into going but even if they did n't change their mind , i 'd go and i 'd make sure the client got the best service and my undivided attention i would request a sit down with my manager i would discuss the negative feedback and see how he she came to feel this way i would want to know every fact to see if the feedback was justified i would find this experience to be very enjoyable i love learning new things and i'm always interested in foreign cultures
i would ask my coworker why they would not change their plans after that i would try to figure out some sort of compromise perhaps one of us could have this vacation time and next time the other would get the vacation time if we could not reach an agreement , i would ask my boss to step in i would try to get the project done as soon as i could this would give me extra time to look over the completed project after i was confident in the finished product , i would ask my boss if there was any last minute projects i would then work on those projects i would go to the meeting , at least for a little while i would ask my coworker to go with me i would try to use that time to network and try and get more work done i would ask other coworkers their opinion about it after talking with them , i would try to have another conversation with my boss if that did not work , i may involve human resources i think it would be an interesting project i also think it would be a good idea to travel saying that , i do not think i would take the project
i would try to convince my colleague first but he ca n't consider my request i have no choice but to change my plans that week is no difference for the next week at work conflict is always in there so someone needs to bend down or else this will no go anywhere i would focus until the project is done cancel all the pleasure and put on hold other unimportant projects if my boss will give a task that i ca n't handle i will be needing to ask help before its too late i know i can do it but sometimes asking help is always helpful this is one of the largest clients and it is a big opportunity to be part of it so i would convince my colleague to go but if he ca n't really go with me for some reason i have to go and be confident i know i can handle this situation i know how to talk to the stranger so there is no problem to deal with them no one can stop me because someone ca n't participate i would get upset but i would handle it in a friendly way and try to correct my manager i would ask my manager why and how he came out of that conclusion and i would express my opinion it is up to my manager if he will change his mind i would accept whatever decision he made i did what i can do i would find this interesting and boring learning another culture is the best thing i love to do but without meeting those people , travelling and seeing it with your own eyes , learning it makes it boring and i might not like it but if travelling and meeting face to face i will go for it
i would take a different week i can enjoy my vacation on another week just as much as the week i had originally planned i do n't really enjoy conflict i would try to complete the project ahead of time it 's better to be safe than sorry why risk getting stressed if my boss throws me more tasks when i do n't have time for them \? i would still go to the networking meeting i do n't mind going to events like these alone sometimes it can be more energizing to be alone i feel bolder and uninhibited i would feel very stressed and defensive i would take some time to reflect and see how my boss is wrong i would write down and collect evidence that proves my good work and then request a meeting with my boss to discuss i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about new cultures it would be even cooler if i got to travel , but even if i did n't , i 'd still enjoy the experience
i would talk to the co worker and ask what they was doing that week if they had scheduled plans like a rented house then i would try and re schedule my week if they did n't have anything scheduled then i would go back to my supervisor and tell them we were at an impasse and they would have to make a decision i would start working on the project asap every boss slips extra work in on you bc once they delegate a project to you they usually forget about it and give you more also a lot can happen in 2 wks so it is better to knock it out soon i would never miss an opportunity to network with a large client i would go there get to know everyone i could you have to take advantage of every opportunity you can i might even take a friend or my wife with me to even everything out i would get a meeting with my manager to discuss the reasons for the negative feedback and try to negotiate a better outcome if that did not work , i would go over my managers head to dispute the feedback and plead my case i would have to weigh the value of the client first is the client worth the time and effort to me to get involved if yes , then i would like the task bc it would be cool to learn about another country and how they handle things hopefully , there would be travel later
i would change my vacation it is a reasonable request to have once of us change our week if my colleague could not or would not change their plans , then i would i would try to get as much work done early as i could i would try to plan so that i would have plenty of time this way if there was a last minute task that i needed to do , i would still be able to complete the project in time i would try to convince my colleague to go i would still go without them , though this would be a good opportunity for networking i would like for my colleague to go , too , but i would go either way i would discuss this feedback with my manager i would feel upset and concerned about my job i would want to make sure that there was n't really a problem with my job that i needed t o fix if the feedback was not true , i would want to correct this mistake i would find this experience very enjoyable this would be a great opportunity to learn something new i enjoy learning about other cultures and think this could be a very rewarding experience
i would change mine if i could if i could n't , i would explain that to them , and hope that they would be more flexible i would try to talk to them and find a solution i would do it quickly i would n't want to take a chance on something else being assigned and i would n't want it to go unfinished i would try to convince them to at least make an appearance and go for a little while at least if they 're there at the beginning , we could meet people together i would tell them they would n't have to stay long i would try to explain why i did n't agree with it i would be nice , but would make sure to get my point across i would n't just accept it i would find it enjoyable i like learning about new places and i think it would be interesting
i would reconsider my vacation , only in case i am staying in my home town but in case i bought tickets to travel or have reservation and planned with other family members i will not cancel my vacation for this time i would try to put the basics for the project right away , and leave some small details for later on since later can be busy i rather do most of the project while have more timei would go to the meeting always at the meetings people introduce each other , even if they do n't know each other before the fact that i am invited means i can socialize with the people therei would try to discuss with the boss , if i can do something to compensate for the negative feedback take classes , some volunteer work , do an extra project help new employee i would try to compensate , so i will get the bonus i would find this experience enjoyable learning about other country , , culture and may be in future the client from this country will invite for visit some people involved in the project
i would offer to change my plans if they could potentially cover a day for me sometime in the future i feel like i am quite reasonable and dont usually like to start any kind of confrontation at work these are people that i have to see everyday so i would prefer to not make anything seem awkward i would immediately get started on the project while the workload remained light this way i could get as much out of the way as possible and give the project my full attention before being distracted by other tasks if it were needed , i would also offer to work overtime to get as far ahead as possible to make the due datei would attempt to convince my colleague to go with me this is a networking event and would be a great way to get to know people to make any invitations to future events less stressful if they still would not come , i would likely still go , as furthering my career is important to mei would gather as much information as i could supporting my point of view i would n't bring any of this information to light unless i had to defend my position this way i could be prepared should it carry any consequences but still keep relationships intacti would absolutely find this to be an enjoyable experience not only do you get to learn about a new culture and explore somewhere new , but you get to do it while furthering your position in the company and making a good impression on the client since you are volunteering for this without pay , the company will value me as an employee which provides additional job security
i would very likely switch my vacation to another week this would depend on whether i had important plans , such as purchased tickets or a special event for the week if i did have a special need for vacation that week i would speak with the supervisor and let her know my specific needs i would continue working on the project assuming that i would not be given any last minute tasks since i have a light work load i would attempt to finish , or mostly finish , the project early if my boss gave me a last minute task i would ask the boss to help me prioritize the tasks since it might be impossible to finish both those last minute tasks and the longer term project in time by asking my boss to help with prioritizing i would take the pressure off of myself i would consider how important or unimportant the networking meeting actually was if it was a meeting i felt i could safely opt out of i would do that however , if it seemed quite important to attend the networking meeting i would go without my colleague since it is a networking meeting , i would attempt to network and get to know new people since i would enter the meeting not knowing anyone i would feel bad about the negative , untrue feedback i would challenge my boss , with a very professional demeanor , to try to convince her of why the feedback was untrue i would do my best to defend my work and keep my bonus i would find this project interesting i am very interested in other cultures and countries i would look at this request as an opportunity to learn about norway 's culture and country , and would enjoy doing so this could be a great learning opportunity and i would like to take full advantage of it
i would most likely change my vacation plans if another week would still work out for my family if however , i needed to have this week off for my vacation then i would speak to my supervisor about the importance of having this vacation approved i would try very hard to start on the project during the time leading up to the due date i am aware that my boss can give me last minute projects and i want to make sure that most of this project has been completed so that i not working on this at the last minute i would most likely go to this networking meeting even if my colleague is not good by since this would be a very important meeting to network with other professionals in my field i would feel initially hurt by the negative feedback that my manager gave me but i would also set up another meeting with him to discuss specific ways that i could improve my performance going forward i would find this experience very enjoyable i am very curious about foreign countries and i would take this as a challenge to learn everything i could about the norwegian culture
i would just cancel my plans if it was easy enough to change the date it 'd be quick and simple , not to mention it 'd probably look good to my supervisor however , i 'd be doing all i can to persuade my if it was n't easy if that means paying my colleague to stay behind this week , then so be it i would start working on it immediately the reason why is because i have the time to do so , and it 's better to get it done sooner than later if i get it done early , i can always slack off for a few days and pretend like i'm hard at work when the boss comes around i would go whether my colleague went or not it 's too important to miss however , i would definitely try to persuade my colleague to go i would be pissed off i 'd try to find a way to make myself look good , but if that turned out to be pretty much impossible , i 'd start looking for a new job i do n't need to waste my time at a place that does n't value my contributions i would find it boring if i did n't travel it 'd be like watching a national geographic documentary on stuff you do n't care about if i did get to travel norway however , i 'd find it enjoyable because it would be an experience
i would try and change my vacation plans , especially if my colleague was n't going to change their mind if i could change my vacation plans around , i would more than likely i would be able to , so i would just take my vacation another week it would n't matter to me very much i would start working on the project first , and work on the lighter tasks in the free time that i have since the project is more important , i would put more time and effort towards it if i had to i would take my work home , and work on the project too if i did n't have enough time regardless of whether my colleague was going to go or not , i would still go it would be important to go , because i would have the chance to network with other people , and have the chance to meet other future clients , and colleague i think it 's more important to be social , so i would go this situation would make me irritated , especially if i knew it was n't true i would say something to my manager , and ask them to reconsider see if they was something i could do to make them change their mind i would n't argue with them though , i would find a way to talk about it without it escalating i would find this experience enjoyable i am part scandinavian , so i would find it more enjoyable finding out more about norway i think it would be even more enjoyable if i could travel to norway , and experience it i would even enjoy if i just learned more about the country , culture , and tried out different food from norway
i would change my vacation plans to accommodate my supervisor and colleague i would than engage both of them to establish a policy to resolve such conflicts in the future for example , i might suggest that a person who most recently took vacation might have a lower priority ranking than someone who has not recently taken leave i would try to finish the project well before the deadline this would allow me to better adapt should my supervisor assign me a task at the last minute if s he did not , then i might volunteer to assist another colleague whose workload was heavier with their project i would offer to go , and ask if my colleague would like to attend the next networking event in my place this way , i could accommodate my colleague , and still create an equitable way to handle this events in the future in so doing , i would earn respect from my coworker and still make our big client happy buy attending the event i would engage my supervisor to discuss the metrics and logic by which this conclusion about my performance was reached i would be sure to bring along evidence to the contrary , if i had it , as i would want to demonstrate that i was doing a good job i would see if there was middle ground , while still hearing out my boss and offering to pursuit courses of action that could alleviate the supervisor 's concerns about my performance i would find it enjoyable , because finding out about other cultures has benefits that extend beyond the workplace i would happily undertake this task , because it contributes to my personal growth , and it would make the client feel as through their cultural sensibilities were being respected if the project went well , i would request to work on further projects with this client , or other norweigian firms
i wouid try talking to him first to see if he has any plans or trip scheduled for the vaca that he cant change then i would compare it to my plans and if i have nothing big planned that would be hard to reschedule then i would gladly let him have the week vaca instead if i had a trip though then i would have to refuse to give it up since hotel booking and plane tickets cost money and i wouldnt want to lose out on money on my vaca so whichever one of us has the harder to change plans then that person will get the vaca first that would be the reasonable way to go about it i would make sure that i got my other tasks out the way first so i could focus on my project fully while im working on my project i would make sure to get it done as fast as i could in case of the last minute tasks so id be working on it all day into the night if i had to , so i could make sure that no matter what other assignment or task i was given , id be able to get my project done on time if i had to and i wasnt finished i would work on it all night thru the morning to get it finished on time i would go alone if i really had too just to keep the client satisfied of course it would not be fun for me to have to go without knwing anyone but since its one of the largest clients i cant afford to let him be an unhappy client if i was there without anyone i know , i would just keep to myself and chat with my client and maybe a few people here and there as long as im able to show up it will look good to my client and keep him satisfied and thats the most important thing to ensure , loosing a big client like that over a meeting would be stupid and immature its not the end of the world if you dont know anyone i would be very pissed and unhappy with the manager i wouldhave to say something to him about it and take it to his higher ups if i had too just to make sure i dont lose my bonus i wouldnt accept that if i knew i did my job right and deserved my bonus sometimes you have to open your mouth and stand up for yourself you cant just let your boss do that to you unfairly so i would definatly take it up with the big boss i would find it enjoyable to learn things about that country that i didnt know ive always been interested in other countries culture and foods and history , so having to learn about norway for a deal with a client i would not mind that at all to me its interesting and fun to see different civilizations and peoples way of life
i would try and see if there is another coworker that would be willing to trade with me or if my supervisor would be willing to work with me on a flexible schedule if there was an opportunity for me to switch with another person or delay a project that would be another option i think most people are reasonable and would work with me knowing i had a planned vacation i would be proactive and remind my boss that i have a significant project coming up and that i want to make sure i am giving it my full attention i would n't mind taking on small tasks if they would n't impact my project or the outcome i think my boss sometimes forgets that i have other things and does n't intentionally mean to give me more work communication would be the key in this situation i would still go to this networking meeting regardless of my colleague attending or not i think this is a great opportunity to meet with our clients and even make new friends not knowing anyone at this outing would not discourage me from attending i am comfortable enough to go and meet new people at an event such as this i would accept the feedback from my manager out of respect , but i would let him know that parts of this might not be accurate i think i would be given the opportunity to explain myself and what my concerns with the feedback were most reasonable people would listen to both sides before submitting something official to a record i feel confident that i would be able to explain my concerns and get them updated accordingly i would definitely volunteer to be a part of this opportunity to learn more about this client and other country i think any people you meet have stories and things to share which will broaden your own mind and knowledge helping out someone from another country can also be a personally rewarding experience i think it is just the right thing to do and it would be enjoyable to learn from someone else
i would go ahead and change my vacation plans i have actually had this scenario happen in the past i would change it to avoid any conflict i would also change my plans to demonstrate i am a team player i would go ahead and complete as much on the project as i could while my work load is light if i can get most of it complete now and my boss hands down more work later , i wo n't have to rush to get it complete i would feel really torn on how to react to this situation i know i need to attend the meeting to make more networking connections but after the long day , a meeting like this seems intimidating i would probably bow out of the meeting as well i would request a meeting with my manager in the meeting i would ask for a more detailed feedback as to why he believes it to be true i would also ask for feedback as to how i can correct the situation i would definitely volunteer to be involved in the project even though i might not get to travel , it is still fascinating to learn about other countries and cultures the experience would be very enjoyable
in this case , it would depend on two things , first , which one of us asked for the time off first the second thing would be can i change the reservations and or travel arrangements for my vacation if i was the first to ask for the time off , i would request that i get the time off unless my plans can easily be changed if the colleague was the one who asked first , then i am out of luck and have to change my plans regardless of the loss to me \( this very thing happened to my daughter n law las year and she had to rearrange her honeymoon even though she had asked for the time off first ! \) i would start working on the new project immediately i would have the full two weeks to work on the project then , if the boss comes up with a last minute something for me to do , i would most likely already be finished with the man project i would rather be finished ahead of time than to be stuck not being able to finish ether project due to lack of time i would have to decide just how important this meeting is since this is major client , i would probably be dealing with a major ego issue in that case , i would more or less be required to attend question \? if this is one of my major clients , why would not know anyone there \? regardless , i would probably end up going to the meeting i would think about t overnight get my thoughts together so i could present a clear , concise argument as to why i disagree with the manager of course , that also depends on the manager being open to discussing it if they are not open to listening to my sde , then i will have to accept that their decision as cut in stone , bite the bullet and accept it after all , the manager does have the final word i would find this very enjoyable i have always loved learning about other places and their cultures this knowledge be helpful to me on this project as it would give me knowledge into how the people i would be working with think and come to their decisions it would also broaden my horizons not to mention being fun to learn about other places
i would change my vacation plan unless there was an urgent reason not to an urgent reason might be planned surgery for an immediate family member or an out of town wedding if it were one of these situations , i would discuss it with my colleague and my boss and try to work out a compromise i would work quickly to complete the project as much ahead of the deadline as possible i would report my status to my boss as i go along from experience , that approach works best your boss will have confidence that you can complete work in an efficient and timely manner i would attend the meeting and meet as many people as possible i would bring a stack of business cards with me it will give me the opportunity to learn more about the business the more people i know , the more effective i will be in the long run i would follow my bosses directive on how to correct the problem i would make sure that my boss was aware that the problem was corrected as he requested i want to make sure i am doing work to the corporate standard i would find the task enjoyable i would make sure that the project plan had the time and money to support the client 's involvement i would also make sure that there were clear ground rules regarding the client 's involvement in the process
i would find out how this was handled in the past i would then find out if i had placed my request for vacation first upon getting that information i would then talk to my supervisor stating that i placed my request first and it should be honored i would start working on this project right away to knock the big chucks out within the first week the second week would be used to fine tune the project any last minute items that might need to be addressed i would do after hours if i did not have the time due to my work load i would talk with my colleague and say that this is a great way to make ourselves known and we should both go i would then negotiate for them to show up for maybe an hour to introduce me to a few people if they still choose not to go then i would end up going by myself this opportunity should not be wasted i would feel concerned about where this feedback is coming from i would analyze the feedback given to me if needed i would discuss this with my peers to find any truth to the feedback i would gather my thoughts on paper and then re approach my manager with my details and discuss further the feedback to try and change his view point i would find this experience enjoyable being involved on projects , especially about other countries provides many ways to broaden my horizon this would also be a chance to get my name in front of other people and add it to my resume
i would gladly change vacation plans if it was doable to be accommodating unless , my plans could not be changed , for instance attending a ceremony or something for my daughter if that were the case i would put my foot down , even at the expense of losing my job life is more important than a job i would probably finish the project as soon as possible before the due date considering this is a large priority and procrastinating could have negative consequences i would try to convince or incentivize my colleague to reconsider regardless , i would still go even if they did n't come because it would be important to network with people in my field i would firstly try to correct the behavior or situation if i truly believed he she were incorrect , i would consider going up the chain and speaking with people higher up about it i would n't necessarily find the task either interesting or boring i would not want to take the project because i would n't want to be responsible for messing up the client relationship due to a cultural issue i am not aware of
i would probably just go ahead and change my vacation plans i never make permanent plans or reservations before ensuring that i am able to be on vacation if a colleague was unwilling or unable to change their plans it would not bother me to change mine i have always put work and my career as more important that vacation this has actually happened to me and since i was in a position that the week i needed was for a wedding , my colleague changed their plans i think what goes around comes around i would jump right on the project while my workload is light since i can foresee that other priorities might arise i would definitely want to finish this project as quickly as possible this would make the project a lot less stressful i would go to the networking meeting it would be in the best interest of my job and possibly future opportunities to go to the meeting while i might feel uncomfortable not knowing anyone present i would definitely attend never know who you might meet at one of these meetings i would go to my desk and sit and go over in my mind exactly what the manager said when he was giving the feedback i would replay the situation to see how he came to his conclusion this would make me extremely angry which is not a good position to take on a discussion i would then make an appointment with the manager and reasonably and calmly ask why he thought my performance was inadequate and try to sell my case on a positive note if after my self reflection i realize he was correct in his negative feedback , i would still go back to my manager and talk with him with a pledge to improve i would find this extremely exciting and not at all boring i enjoy learning new things and would like the challenge of learning about norway and the culture i would really like an opportunity to travel , but would accept that this might not happen
i would not have a choice but to change my vacation plans hopefully i have not already paid deposits or made plans that cannot be changed if i had and there was no way to adjust my vacation , i would find out which one of us technically requested the week off first whoever did should receive the week i would start as soon as possible it makes sense to at least have a mental outline of how much time and work the project will require i would be taking notes immediately i would not want to go , especially if my colleague is n't going however , i would go it is in my best interests to attend events large clients invite me to it 's only an hour or so of my time , and the payoff is building a stronger relationship with a client who is an important component of my job put in that perspective , it 's a no brainer i might try to convince my colleague to go too i would approach it very diplomatically i would start compliment sandwich style i would thank the manager for their honest feedback and their time i would then find and deliver quantifiable reasons why the feedback is not true i would make my case , but then ask for a candid discussion with the manager just because i do not perceive the feedback to be true does n't mean it 's not , or that it is n't helpful i am being offered a perspective other than my own , and i would want to be more curious than defensive i would probably find it boring , especially if no travel was offered why would i be finding out this information on a volunteer basis \? how would it advance my career \? would i be a liaison to the client \?
i would have to change my leave and take it in a different week i have to do this since i do not want my office work to suffer i need to inform my family about this change and i definitely know they will accept this change i would be handling this project with caution given the possibility that my boss may give me some last minute jobs to handle even though i know that i have sufficient time for the project till the due date but i would approach this with caution i would try to finish all the critical jobs in the project first so that the non critical part will be required to handle during the later part of the project i would have to definitely go since my colleague has already decided to abstain from that meeting this meeting will also help me get introduced with a lot of other people who would play a very important role in my official job hence whatever may be the time i would definitely make it for the evening meeting i would like to forget this negative feeedback from my manager and not take this along with me in the future the reason for not taking it alongwith in the future that it should not effect my future assignments however i would also talk to my manager and explain to him the situation so that this negative feedback does not effect my bonus i would definitely find this assignment very interesting and enjoyable the reason is that i would be able to interact with a person who is different from my country and culture and this would enable me to learn a lot of things i would also come to learn a lot of things about this person who is from a different country
if i do not have any reservations made , i would concede i would pick another week to keep the peace with my coworker if i had already made some plans , i would suggest that we each take a portion of the week \( mon thur , fri sun \) and then each take the necessary number of days before the week and after \( fri sun week prior , mon thur week after \) that way we could each get at least some of the days we want , and the charges to change my reservations would be kept to a minimum i would start getting as much done as early as possible this way , i will be prepared for whatever comes in the future i would also be able to volunteer for extra work tasks , which would help enforce my competency and dedication i would go regardless i would try to convince my coworker to go though , explaining the great opportunity it would be and offer to purchase them some coffee even if they decided not to though , i would still go because i would n't let uncomfortability intervene in my opportunities i would ask my manager for a one on one conversation for clarification i would ask them to explain their reasons for the feedback i would internalize it and acknowledge if there is any truth i would also express my reasonings for disagreement i would then carry on with my work , making sure to consider their feedback in my daily actions i would definitely find it enjoyable i love learning about new cultures , and find different people very interesting although i would enjoy traveling there even more , i would look forward to learning and growing my perspectives of the world
i would try to have the supervisor determine who should take their vacation on this date based on who requested it first , that way it is fair if it were at the same time i would ask to be determined by seniority one 's plans should not be ruined just because the other will not fold this is a dispute that should be handled by a third party out of fairness i would not give in either if it were up to me i would dedicate extra time to the project when i have the chance i would try to complete the project early if my boss hands me extra work and i can accomplish both , i will if my boss hands me work that will interfere with the project , i would admit that i cannot do both and will either need help or the task to be delegated to someone else i would go to the networking project alone , but i would try to encourage the coworker to attend with me i would n't be pushy , just emphasize that this is something that could help boost his career i would offer to drive him there , but if he says no i would accept that this actually happened to me at work this year i checked my performance with another manager and the information contrasted with the negative feedback i received i brought that information back to the manager who provided the negative feedback and asked that he review the situation he ended up finding out that he misread the data and assigned me feedback intended for another associate i felt badly when i first received the feedback but after realizing it was n't accurate i questioned my managers attention to detail and competency to myself i would find the experience enjoyable i am always open to learning new things and have never been outside of the us i would request to travel if possible and would enjoy the research either way
i would probably first try to negotiate with him depending on how important my vacation is , i would offer him an incentive if it were n't as important , i would just end up working rather than cause a problem with my colleague i would probably first contemplate how important the project is to my job if it were n't anything major , i would n't worry too much about it being late or anything if it were important , i would try to obtain an extension for the deadline i would probably try to convince my colleague to go if he refused , i would still ask to do something with him after the networking event just to have company other than that , i would go to the networking meeting by myself regardless of his decision i would most likely keep my mouth shut i say this because the bonus would be very valuable to me this is because i could use the bonus to by christmas presents and afford to go on vacation i would probably find it enjoyable this is because i have always been interested in meeting diverse people it would also help me with global networking
i would take one for the team i would reschedule and change my plans i think doing this would make the boss really like the way i handled myself i also think my coleague would owe me one i would try to finish this project as soon as possible i know that my boss loads me at the last second in knowing this i would take the needed steps in case i need it i would seize the bull by the horns to speak without risk there is no reward i would go introduce myself and in the process possibly make some solid networking i could potentially be well rewarded i would take the criticism and try to make myself better i would try to perform better even though i felt i was doing good i would do so well that my boss could not say otherwise i would find this exiting i think learning about other cultures is fun and exciting it would also show my boss i am willing to go the extra mile
i would change my vacation i would also make sure that my supervisor is aware that i will volunteer to change my plans i would also make sure that my supervisor was aware that my colleague refused to i would make sure that i get the project finished on time i would work very hard on the project while my workload was light i would have it done early in case i become overwhelmed with last minute work i would go to the networking meeting it 's very important in that it 's with one of our largest clients i will make a good showing even though i will not know anyone i would ask for a meeting with my manager i would talk with them about the negative feedback and explain my side of the issue i would be polite but firm with my feelings i would find this experience enjoyable i am curious about other countries and cultures i think that it will help my company and help my future with the company
first i will request him to change his plans and if he does n't change it then i will change my plans i will make sure to let my supervisor know that this time i changed it but next time if that happens my colleague has to change iti will try to finish my work before time i know my boss is going to give me last minute task so i will make a schedule accordingly and will now procrastinate but i will try to convince my boss not to give me that much work since i have to finish my projecti would still go as it will increase my network i believe that even if i will not know anyone , i will be able to enjoy it is definitely be a win win case for my futurei would try to explain my side of story and make sure to show my manager all the positive side i will feel really sad about it but will definitely try to convince my boss that i will do better next time i will find it boring but still i will volunteer because it will give me opportunity to learn about new country and their culture and may be in near future gives me a chance to travel as well
i would oblige to working the same week we both requested off thinking ahead , i could probably find an even better time to take my vacation also , this would gain positive attention from the boss i would take a couple days to complete this project as much as possible so i would n't have to worry about it if something comes up this way i can focus on other projects also , i could turn in a project early and hopefully receive praise from my boss i would still go regardless if my colleague goes or not this is a very important client and should be taken seriously going to this event could open up a variety of great opportunities i would request a meeting with my manager this way i can get any conflict out in the open and help resolve it i think i would feel really confused and hurt , especially putting in quality work i would find this experience very enjoyable i think learning about your client is very important , it shows that you value their business also , being cultured is a great asset to show clients you are open minded
it would depend on if mine were set in stone \( i e i was going to lose money on a deposit or not be able to go a different week \) if that was the case , i would ask the supervisor who had asked for time off first and suggest that that person get to keep their week if mine was more flexible , then i would just change to a different week , but let the colleague know that it was a one time thing i would get the project done as early as possible , so that way i would be ready for any last minute tasks i would start it right now , at the start of the two week window then , i would be extra confident that it would be done on time i would probably force myself to go , but not stay long after a long day , it would be really hard to make myself go to an event where i do n't know anyone however , the networking opportunity \( plus the chance to impress a big client \) we be too good to pass up i would feel really disappointed and let down by this situation i would ask my manager for more information about the feedback in the hopes of convincing him or her to see my side of it i would also see if there was anyone else in the company who would be willing to speak up on my behalf , hopefully helping to secure my annual bonus i would find this experience enjoyable it would be fun to mix things up with a client from another country , and i would enjoy learning about a new place even if it does n't lead to work travel , it would help me if i ever decided to take a personal trip to norway
i would try to talk with my colleague about the situation if we both cant agree on the problem i would step down and be the bigger person i would let him have it and then it would be my turn i would try to finish this project as fast as i can if my boos gives me last minute work to do i would have plenty of time to get it done i think is better if this project is done ahead of time like that i would have space for other things that might come up i would still go to the party even if my colleague wont go i think is important to network and make good friendships this party could have a positive effect on me if i meet the right people i would try to break down the situation with my manager i would express my point of view on why i do n't agree if my manager wont understand where i'm coming from would start to look for a better job i would find this experience enjoyable this experience would give me the chance to learn new things i like doing new projects and i'm the type of person who enjoys new experiences
i would first determine whether my colleague already had bookings \( e g hotel room , plane tickets \) if they did and i did not , i would cede the time to them however , if i did and they did not , i would make the case for the time to be given to me if neither of us had any plans booked already , i would determine whether either of us had a reason that we had to take the vacation that specific week \( e g family wedding \) realistically , i would probably put off a lot of the work until the last minute , because that is how i tend to work i am most productive and work best under pressure i would try to do it with enough time to allow for last minute tasks most likely if they decide not to go i would also not go because i would feel uncomfortable however , if there is a potential big reward for going \( e g a high income project \) then i would consider going i would feel angry and upset i would try to take a step back and calm down before further addressing the situation once i felt calmer , i would address the manager and offer reasons why i felt their feedback was not accurate i would find it enjoyable , although i would much prefer being able to travel as part of the opportunity however , even just learning about a different culture may provide something different and interesting
first i would hope that whatever i have planned could be changed i think it also should depend on who has been there the longest if it were myself i would insist on my original plan but if the other colleague was there the longest i would have to change my plans would n't be thrilled but what else could i do i would make sure my project was up to date so if something came up at the last minute i would still be ready i always try to be prepared just in case something unexpected happens or is added to the job i would try to convince my colleague to go to the networking meeting with me tell him we should both go to get a different prospective on the meeting if he still would n't go , i would go by myself and probably would be fine , because i'm sure i 'll get to know the people there i would attempt to look into the negative feedback and where it came from if i did n't think it was accurate i would collect the information to prove it so i would n't loose my annual bonus if i could prove it my boss would be appreciative to me instead of negative i would definitely think this was interesting of course it would be nice to travel but it also could be fun to learn about norway and it 's culture not boring at all !
i would probably go ahead and let my coworker have the week , if i had n't already scheduled plans i tend to shoot for the approval first , then make the plans , to avoid this type of matter i would n't let it affect me too much , and i would be sure to let the supervisor know , to remember my leniency i would do some work every day , especially if my workload was currently light that way , i could be consistent , and still get a good portion of work done as it came closer to the deadline , i would also feel more comfortable , knowing that i 've already submitted a body of work , and that any last minute tasks would n't throw me off schedule i would hate it , but would probably go i would definitely be reluctant to , even moreso given that my colleague probably wo n't be there i would still go , but depending on how things went , i would attempt to leave at the first opportunity that would n't be considered rude all things considered , it 's likely that i would have a good time i would not respond right away i would leave the situation , and give myself time to cool off when i 'd feel that the time was right , i would then go ahead and give myself about another hour or so , and possibly talk the matter over with either my lady or my mentor i would definitely take the feedback seriously , and attempt to incorporate any changes down the road i would find this experience interesting , not boring i ca n't say whether it would be enjoyable or not at this point , but i would take on the task at hand i would keep an open mind , and consider it a learning experience
i would allow them to have their vacation time i would then request vacation for the next week and add an extra day to my request just because i could the inconvenience of scheduling warrants an extra day i would make time for the project i would set weekly goals to not overwhelm myself i would n't want to wait until the last minutei would still go because discomfort encourages growth i could have a great networking opportunity there i would n't want to miss thati would smile and say thank you for the feedback i may or may not share my thoughts i would move on because a job will matter less the more financial independence i create for myself i would find it fun i lke to meet new people and encourage others i would enjoy it
i would be willing to compromise with my colleague , and change my vacation week i believe i have the ability and can be flexible when i host my vacation , and given the situation my colleague may not have the same luxuries or flexibility i would compromise with my colleague , as it resolves the situation quickly and without aggression or further tension i would work harder and allocate more time and resources towards completing the project i would try and attempt to finish the project prior to the deadline , and much faster than the 2 weeks expected in response to any additional tasks , i would utilize the renaming time to handle the tasks , and would give my upmost attention to those tasks if the project is not yet completed , i would primarily focus on the main project , and allocate some time to the additional tasks to ensure that all are accomplished in a timely manner i would attend the networking meeting anyway the meeting is a great opportunity to meet with the client , and essentially interact with others to improve my network and social support although it would be difficult without my colleague , i have the skills and mindset to attend the meeting and accomplish all i set off to do i would feel that the situation would be unfortunate , and i would feel slightly terrible about receiving negative feedback however , i would not argue with my manager in response to the feedback , given the potential consequences and that the benefits from doing so is minuscule i would thus attempt to improve my work and efforts , taking into consideration the feedback , if applicable , to ensure that my manager does not think lowly of my work and efforts the experience would definitely be enjoyable for me to be involved in learning about a country and culture is an experience that i value , and would be a interesting experience for me to undertake traveling is not a necessity for me to be able to enjoy and learn about a culture or country , and i think the project would give me that particular opportunity in addition , interacting with the client would give me experience and improve my skill set at performing my job
i would check to see who summited the request first and go from there if we did this at the same time i would ask if her time off was medical or set in stone like already purchased plane tickets or something i also would more then likely be able to change mine i would not wait till last minute i would start on it now if possible since the workload is light if the boss asked for last minute tasks i would ask which one is more important or see if someone could help with things i would go that way i can meet new people and maybe get more clients i would not want to disappoint my large client that invited me i would not care if my colleague went or not if it could being career opportunitiesi would let my manager now that i disagree and show proof or others in to verify i do not this managers see everything i would not risk losing what is owed to me if i believed it to truly not be true i would fine this experience enjoyable because i would get to see what someone from another country thinks i would like to know their ideas and their thoughts about things on the project i think it is always a good idea to get others from different countries involved to get different thoughts
i would change my plans it sounds as though my colleague may have plans that involve considerable travel and hotel reservations , so , assuming he 's locked in to these plans , i 'd be willing to change mine knowing that my boss pulls this kind of stuff , i would try to get the project finished as soon as possible i have a light workload , so i could get the project done fast , assuming the boss will load me up with extra tasks towards the end i would go , but would try to schmooze a bit and get away early i hope my friend wo n't be disappointed or angry , but if i'm tired i just cannot stay at the event long fearing that i 'd lose my annual bonus , which i really need , i would challenge his feedback , especially if it goes upstairs i believe that bosses should not ride roughshod over their workers , and that workers should stand up for themselves i would find it enjoyable it 's always interesting and stimulating to learn about a foreign country or culture it would certainly not bore me
i would obviously have to change my plans i would not complain and give my co worker that date they wanted i would do that in hopes of my boss noticing and possibly give me the option of making sure i got the week i wanted next year , with no problems i would work on the project when i could during the light period that way i wouldnt be waiting til the last moment and also i would be close to finishing in case something else came up in the meantime , or i could still brainstorm for better ideas i would go i think it would be beneficial to my job and future it would be a little uncomfortable at first but after a drink it would n't be as uncomfortable i would hope anyways ! i would look at the situation from their point of view and then try to understand why they said what they did then i would do my best to remedy the situation or refrain from making the same mistake again i would defiantly volunteer i love learning and i also love different cultures and ways of living i would enjoy the experience and would n't mind traveling either
i would ask my supervisor who asked for the week off first i think whoever asked first should get the week off if it was me , i would insist on getting the week off , and if it was my colleague , i would pick another week i would much rather get my work done right away that way it would be done , or i could tweak it in the time left over and if my boss came up with any last minute tasks , i would have plenty of time to give to them i would go anyway i would think it would be good to meet with one of the largest clients i could possible get ahead in knowing what is going on , and it would give me a boost in my job i would start by asking for clarification on the feedback i would ask my manager how she he thinks i should have handled the issue and what they would like me to do to rectify it in the future i would really enjoy that ! i like learning about people and countries i'm not familiar with i would like to talk to people from norway , and see how i could be helpful to the project
i would allow him to take the vacation and marc it down next time when i need i will take vacation this way i can show some empathy to the other person and also become trusted by supervisor i would try to work in a way so that my boss knows where i am at and he can not give extra task since i will keep him updated all the time i will still go try to communicate with someone new this way i can sharpen my network with outside organization i will take them as a learning experience any feedback no matter positive or negative is acceptable i would find this experience enjoyable because it will help me to learn a lot of new things
i would first talk to my family and find out if our plans can be changed if my family had no issues in delaying our vacation for a week or two , then i would accept working the week my collegue wants to go if my family cannot go in a later week or two , then i would ask some type of payment or value to compensate for me for my lost amount of vacation i would first set up a plan and listing what actions need to be completed at what specific time i would also try to establish within my time enough room to compensate for my bosses last minute tasks once the plan was established i would implement it i would go no matter what the meeting is with my largest clients and this meeting should provide security to my job also the networking would give me a better chance to excel at my job finally i feel confident that i can handle meeting people i do n't know i would on the surface and professionally state ok and state i would do better next time i would continue to ask more feedback on how i need to improve and ask for specific actions my manager wants done then i would establish plan to figure out how to complete those actions i would find it complete enjoyable part of my ancestry is norway so it would help me to get better knowledge about my heritage also norway is beautiful place and i would hope this give me a chance to visit it
it depends if i have planned ahead of time , and can not change it , i would talk to my colleague and try to persuade him to change their vacation plans if my vacation is flexible , it is fine , and i would change my plan and let him to take vacation i would take more time to make preparation and make me look busy to avoid my boss give me last minute tasks because i do n't want to let last minute tasks ruin my plan , in that case , i may not finish my project well i would have the networking meeting with my client i do n't think my colleague will interfere the meeting , and also , i do n't care about if he will know about that i just need to focus the meeting with the client i would feel bad , and try to set a time to discuss it with my manager because in this case , it seems i was misunderstood , i hope to talk to the manager and see why and what happened eventually , the manager will change his evaluations on me i would enjoy this experience because i need to learn something about norway and their culture by involving the project , though i may not travel there while dealing this project , at least , i can learn something new
i would schedule my vacation a different week my colleague seems to be unwilling to compromise , so there would be no point in arguing with them i can be flexible i would try to finish the project as soon as possible while my workload is light knowing that my boss would potentially give me last minute tasks , i would prioritize and finish up the project as early as possible i would try to convince my colleague into going i would tell them the reasons why it would be beneficial to go if i could not convince them , then i would just go myself i would feel disappointed and upset at the negative feedback i would feel it was n't justified i would want to rectify the situation any way i could i would complain to someone in authority before any real consequences would happen i would find this experience enjoyable i would find it beneficial to learn about another country , even if i did n't travel there i am always interested in learning about different cultures
it would depend what they are doing on their vacation i would try to working things out if the things they were going to do had more meaning or importance than mine i would focus on completing the project as soon as possible because my boss could assign me to another task without me knowing causing the current project to not be finished i would still likely go and make an appearance i would not stay long but , i would try to network with others i would look at what the feedback was and if it was valid i would then look to see if it is something that was reoccurring or not i would then argue my case against the feedback showing that i am better and prove my side of the story i would find it enjoyable it is always a great opportunity to meet new people and areas of the world i think it would be an exciting opportunity
i would talk to my colleague about the importance of her vacation i would see if she 's willing to take a different week if my colleague do not agree i would just take a different week so that the job would be covered i would constantly work on my project although my workload is light there my be other things that may hinder me from completing my project if i complete the project first i would have room for unexpected tasks i would encourage my colleague to attend because it is a very important meeting i would tell him her that their support would mean the world to me if he she decide not to attend i would probably find someone else or go alone and mingle with someone new this meeting is very important to me i would speak with my manager and explain to him in a polite manner why i do n't agree with his feedback i should not lose a bonus for something negative i would take the negative feedback and turn it into a positive thing if he 's willing to work with me i would get involved in the project because learning new things about another country is interesting traveling is sometimes hectic so just to be able to learn and maybe speak with someone from norway would be more convenient closing a deal with a client is a big thing so of course i would volunteer to work on the project
i would ask my co worker why they cannot change their plans , perhaps they have to attend an event or have already booked their flight , etc if my own plans are flexible , i would adjust them to another date to avoid conflict if we both cannot agree , i would expect the supervisor to make the deciding decision depending on who asked for the time first , or if there are other deciding factors i would begin the project as soon as possible knowing that my boss often assigns last minute things to do , i feel it would be less stressful to begin working on it asap rather than procrastinate and be overwhelmed at the last minute by starting sooner rather than later , i will have more confidence in myself that i can accomplish the task in the required amount of time given i would attend the function ! it 's all about networking and meeting other people , so why not \? sure , i would be tired , but would treat this as an opportunity to further my knowledge with the client and build new connections i would ask my manager why they gave me the negative feedback , what their reasoning was in doing so i would also voice my opinion that i disagree with them , and that i would like to see if we could make a compromise if , for some reason that does not work , then i would take it higher and speak with their supervisor giving them the reasons why i do not believe that the negative feedback was fair or justified and see what results i can get from that conversation in order to settle the matter i would volunteer i like learning about new cultures and new countries and would use this as a learning opportunity to learn more about the client , their business , as well as their culture , all things that might be beneficial to me in the future within my position granted , it would be volunteering myself to take on more at work , but in the end it could prove to have positive consequences for me and the company i work for
i would agree to move my holidays because i hate arguing i would agree to move my vacation because i have not planned anything yet i would agree to move my holidays , but the next time my needs come first i would talk with my boss about my ending project i would give my main project priority i would do some extra work i would go but without enthusiasm i would try to convince my colleague to come with me i would drink a strong coffee before to go i would feel treated unjustly i would try to talk with my responsible i would work with less enthusiasm i would find the experience interesting because it is different from the tasks i perform normally i would like to inform myself about the cultures of other countries because i am curious and i believe that it opens the mind i would like know more about norway because it fascinates me
i would just wait for another week to take my vacation i would try not to make a big deal about it and i may look as someone who doesnt create problems in front of the supervisor or bossi would take the work i received from my boss and do it the best of my ability but i would try to work fast it annoyed me but i have to do it and show that i can work under pressurei would go , because is importsnt for me to try to get that client and maybe i could get other jobs with him if we get alongi would feel motivated to improve my work i would tp the person who gave me the feedback to see what can i do to make it better and to not consequences laterthis experience would be enjoyable because i would get to know another culture and people from another country which i find very interesting and rich to be able to talk to someone that has different ways than us
i would stay and work it is important for us to all make sacrifices this would be my way of contributing to the team and be helpful to others i would ask up front whether or not there would be additional tasks i like to get ahead of things if i know that my boss has the tendency to assign more work , then i might be able to start extra work quicker and balance my time better i would suggest to my colleague that we both go if he did not want to go i would go by myself anyway i do n't need others around to feel supported and this would be important to attend for me i would listen to what my manager had to say regardless of whether i like the feedback or not it is important to find out whether it is true or not i would use the opportunity to find out more about his thinking i would find this experience enjoyable learning new things always excites me as i am very inquisitive this would be a great opportunity for me to broaden my knowledge
i would let my boss know that it is unfair hopefully , one of us asked first and the second person will just have to re schedule their vacation most places i 've worked for over the last 44 years go by seniority and who put the request in first it 's only fair if i was given a project due in two weeks , i would begin working on it now i do n't take chances that my boss will give me a last minute task that would add to my stress since my workload is light , i would do some work on this project every day that i work if i did n't have previous plans for the evening , i would probably go at least for a little while it does n't bother me that i do n't know anyone there in these cases , most meetings are scheduled a couple of days in advance so people can make plans i would not plan on making an entire evening of being with the clients , though first thing that comes to mind is how did we get along before this feedback \? were we at each other 's throats all the time \? was this totally surprising \? since most people know what their relationship with their boss is good or bad , i am a little confused with this one if it were me , i 'd probably question as to why he she feels that way please explain why i was given the reason , documented and i may complain to his her boss i do n't think i 'd mind volunteering for the project depending on what would be involved if i needed to learn the language , it would take time i would need more details about what my responsibilities would be also , could travel be requested to meet the client face to face \?
i would simply change my vacation week i think it would be too much unnecessary hassle to argue or negotiate about it this is especially important because she already had vacation plans i m usually pretty flexible i would get as much as i can done as soon as possible this way i am basically scheduling in extra time in case there is something last minute i would also let me boss know that i do have this project in two weeks that is important so that they are aware of my workload i would go to the networking meeting i would not plan one staying there long if i don t have to this seems like it would give me an edge to getting to know this important client anyway i would take the feedback and continue the conversation feedback is meant for the employee to grow , so i would ask my manager how i can do better specifically , and if i could get feedback more often if i show initiative for getting better , than i think that would create a positive image for me i would find this experience enjoyable because i can learn about other cultures if i do decide to go to norway one day , i can be prepared also , this can be an opportunity for me to do something outside of my normal workload which could be entertaining
i would want to know when they had put in for their vacation , if i had put in first for the time off , then i should be the one to get the time off if we asked at the same time , it would depend on whose vacation was able to be refunded or the dates changed if i could change mine then i happily would i would try to finish the project before the due date i would do this in case my boss gave me last minute tasks , so that i would have the time left to finish those tasks i would most likely go anyway if it is one of our largest clients , then it would probably be beneficial to get to know them while it may be difficult at first because i would n't know anyone , it would be a great opportunity to help further my career i feel that this situation could go very wrong if handled incorrectly i would go to my boss and ask what i am doing wrong if it is something that can be fixed , i will fix it if the feedback is incorrect on how i act , i may take it up with his boss as to make sure no negative repercussions are had by me or my boss i believe i would find this experience ver enjoyable i love learning about diffrent cultures from around the world while traveling would be fun , just learning about the country would be enjoyable by itself
i would talk to my colleague and see what they were doing for their vacation i would do what i could to try and rearrange my schedule to get the time off i needed i would also talk to my manager to see if there was anything else that could be done i would work as hard as i could to get the project completed as assigned if new tasks were assigned i would add them to my workload and work them into the timeline i would strive to complete everything in the given time i would still attend the event it would be important to the company it could be important to my career i would still continue to do my job i would try to do work according to the job description and instruction i would apply the feedback as best as i could within reason i would enjoy this experience i like to learn about new things it would be interested to learn about a new culture
i would change my plans so my colleague could go but as a trade off , if it happens again in the future then my colleague would have to change their plans and stay they may have a good reason why they wo n't change their plans i will be flexible this time as i like to be a team player and be supported of my fellow co workers i would make sure everything is done on time and leave room for any unexpected tasks that my boss may give me i know i can handle the project but i must be prepared and ready for the unexpected i hope that my boss can appreciate my hard work and willingness to do things on time and go the extra mile i would go even if i had a long day and would't know anyone as it is one of my largest clients i need to be informed about what is going on in the meeting and any work related information my job is important to me and my clients as well so making the sacrifice to go is worth it in the long run i hope to get future promotions in my organization and reap the benefits of my hard work i would try and talk to my manager and see why they feel this way about my work i would explain why i feel they are wrong and hope that we could work it out i do feel a bit hurt by the feedback because i know that i am a good employee and very reliable and always give my all , i will continue to do my best work and hope that the manger sees that and next time will give me positive feedback i would find it interesting and enjoyable i love to learn new things especially about other cultures the fact that i may not even have to travel to participate is a plus
i would talk to my supervisor if i had scheduled my vacation first then i would expect him to make my colleague switch their vacation if i had scheduled second then i would change without being told i would stay on top of the project and not wait until the last minute especially since my boss sometimes gives last minute tasks that can take significant amounts of time this way i know it will all be done on time i would still go i would be disappointed that that my colleague was not going because sometimes it is awkward not knowing anyone but , since it is our largest client , i would go i would be upset to begin with just over the negative feedback because i take pride in my work i would also want a serious talk with my manager to explain i do not agree i would expect to get everything worked out for the better i would find this experience enjoyable it would be something new to learn while at work it would also be fun to do this
i would start by talking to my colleague and discussing the importance of the vacation to both of us if it is extremely important to both of us i would talk to my manager to see if there is any way that we can both take vacation despite the policy if the vacation is more important to my colleague i would cover for them and move my vacation to another time this is important because i want to get buy in with my coworkers and with my manager my colleague would owe me and would also work hard for me in the futurei would start by doing as much as i can on the project due soon this is important because i want to get it done as soon as possible given that i can get work late from my boss i want to make sure to get this project done in anticipation of future work the worst case is that i finish early and have more down time in the future i would still go networking events are important to meet new people so i do n't just need my colleague there its possible that i could meet more clients and also want to get facetime with our client i think this is the best professional move for me i would feel sad but would start by going back into the office and asking for more information i want to show my boss that i am a dedicated worker and that i want to get more feedback on my performance i would feel slightly uncomfortable since this could become confrontational but i would be professional and show that i am a hard worker looking to improve i would find this very enjoyable i like learning about new cultures and would want to learn about a different country this could be a great opportunity for me to broaden my horizons
i would change my plans i would do it to avoid conflict in the workplace i would feel too stressed out if i did not accommodate somebody i would work on the project a little everyday in case something unexpectedly arises at the last minute this would give me some leeway to finish the project on time i would go anyway i would go so that i ould be the one that was most informed i would then have superior knowledge over my colleague from work i would discuss the feedback with my manager i would put my facts in writing i would list my accomplishment s that i made and i would present it all in a positive manner i would find this experience enjoyable it does n't seem like there is much risk since i do n't have to go there it would give me knowledge that i did n't have before it would give me something to talk about with my colleagues
i would most likely give in to him or her i don t like confrontation , and i will adjust my schedule to avoid it unless i had something already specifically planned , i would not put up a fight about it i would most likely go ahead and get started on the project i don t like procrastination and having it done early gives me a sense of relief also , the unforeseen additional tasks would stress me out i would most likely go anyway even if my coworker didn t i would probably just stop by and at least show my face to the client i would still feel like i would need to go even if my coworker did not i don t typically take criticism well so i probably would be very upset if i truly believe the feedback wasn t true i would try to talk to them to get a better understanding of it i would also try to convince them that it is not correct i would absolutely find it enjoyable i like learning about different cultures , and i would enjoy that as part of my job
i would react differently depending on which one of us requested the vacation time first if my colleague request first then i would allow him or her to go if i ask first then i would allow my colleague to go i would not procrastinate knowing that my boss at times will give me extra work i would make the effort to try and complete project as soon as possible doing this will ensure that i will meet the deadline regardless of what might happeni would make a serious effort to convince my colleague to join me if i fail at convincing my colleague then i would go alone i would feel very sad , angry and frustrated about the negative feedback because i disagree with the feedback i would feel unappreciated and a sense that there is an effort to fight against me i would definitely try to reason with the manager and to try and come to an understanding i would be indifference about this project i do n't see it as an exciting nor boring project i would volunteer for this project if traveling was involved because that would be exciting
i would most like change my vacation plans obviously , if one person has to change and the other wo n't , then it 's up to the second person to change i'm pretty flexible , anyway i would definitely start on the project immediately i would try to have it mostly done beforehand that way , if my boss gives me last minute work , i wo n't be stressed trying to handle two jobs at once i would make an agreement with my colleague i would go to this network meeting my colleague could go to the next network meeting that would be most fair i would set up a follow up meeting with my manager i would first try to find out more information from my manager as to why i received the negative feedback i would discuss how i saw the situation i would bring supporting documents to backup my claims , if it was appropriate i would find the experience enjoyable i enjoy learning about new countries and cultures this would give me an opportunity to learn about norway and could possibly lead to a trip there , either through this project or simply on my own reconnaissance this would also give me a push to pursue my interest in other countries
i would not change my plans either i would make the boss decide which one of us were to go on vacation if they are n't willing to talk and work something out with me then why should i go out of my own way \? i would go ahead and get started on it i'm not a big procrastinator i would go ahead and work on it as much as i can i 'd even try to finish it early in case my boss decided to throw me a curve ball at the last minute i would probably not go i do n't like meeting new people and i'm so uncomfortable at parties if the only person i knew was n't going to be going , chances are i would bail myself i would sit down and have a conversation with my boss i would tell them i do n't agree with their evaluation and that it 's going to significantly impact my compensation i 'd ask if we could sit down and talk about why they thought that way and see if we could come to some sort of understanding where i can grasp what i was doing wrong and maybe it would n't impact my job so hard i would probably not be very into this project i like more traditional and mechanical type tasks i usually do n't go too far outside of my box with cultures and trying to navigate foreign relations
i would take one for the team and change my vacation date due to the stubbornness of my colleague i would do this in order to avoid any drama and bitterness it would make working together less stressful and would be the fastest way to move on i would try and finish and prepare the project early given the fact that my boss is likely to give last minute tasks , getting the project done early is probably the smart way to approach the situation this choice would prevent any last minute changes to the project and better prepare myself for success having it done early and not worry about it when working on other tasks i would still go to the networking event i feel like that 's the point of these kinds of events , it 's to get to know new people and create connections i do n't think relying on someone else would further my career i would talk to my manager about the negative feedback i would try to learn from their critique to show that i really do care about their opinion and show that i am trying to better my performance i feel like this approach would help my chances in not losing the bonus as well as learn from my mistakes i would feel that this experience would be a little boring to be honest if there are no travel incentives in conjunction to what i have to learn concerning the client 's country , then i do n't see the point i feel like learning about their culture is rather just a scapegoat situation where a subordinate would learn their customs and culture to be the spokesperson for the company
i would try and talk to them about seeing what can be done then i would ask them where they are going and would want to know when they are going so that we can try to work something out if they ca n't work something out , then i would just take vacation the next week i would work on the project every day or i would work on the project as much as i could as fast as i can before my boss assigns something else for me this way i can finish on time regardless i would still go because it is more beneficial for me to go i would try and socialize with everybody there and try to network with them it 's better to meet new people and get out of your comfort zone especially if it involves business i would try to talk with my manager more about the feedback and try to understand why they gave me that feedback then i would try to let them know what i will do to improve and what i can do to improve i would find the experience enjoyable because it is always fun learning about other countries and their cultures , this is also being done for something related to the work i would be in and it is good to show you care enough to be willing to learn about a new culture and country for the sake of your business
i would change my vacation plans and take my vacation one week after my colleague this is because i believe in my colleague and i would not want there to be an issue at all with my supervisor and not getting time off because only one of us gets it also , i believe that it 's the right thing to do given the circumstances of the situation and then i would still get my vacation time off no problem at all i would start by getting the project done almost completely early by this i mean i would do about 90 to 95 of it ahead of the due date and would finish it by doing the rest of it the last 2 days it was due i would also not complain if there were last minute tasks i had to do and i would just do the best i could with the last few pieces of it to finish this is what i would do overall and by doing this i'm pretty sure that even if some issues came up i would be able to handle them well since the project would be almost done i would not go because of a few reasons such as me getting anxious easily and not knowing anyone there also , by me not going there it makes my life a lot less anxious and means that the colleague i do n't know will be in the same boat as me i would also not go since i would be stressed out after being there for just 20 to 30 minutes at all i would feel bad about the situation and disheartened , but i would see what the feedback entailed before i made a drastic change i would if the feedback was bad and was an excuse to make me lose my standing and for me not to be working there , i would just take the feedback and quit at the end of the same day i would also flush it and not try to remember my boss and what experiences i had had with them as well , save for the work skills i had learned i would find this experience boring , because it sounds like homework to me i'm not interested in also , i would not appreciate having to do this unless it had something worth my while to do it because of this i probably would n't do it and plus , i do n't care for learning a ton about country and culture in other countries except for japan and ireland
i would insist that the vacation week should be taken by whichever one of us requested it first i would believe that if my colleague is not willing to change their plans , i should not be expected to be willing to change mine i would probably feel negatively about this colleague following the incident i would start working on the project as soon as possible just in case my boss starts to pile work on me i would almost certainly feel anxiety about working for such a disorganized boss i would probably start looking for a job with a more reasonable boss i would find out who went to the last networking event if my colleague skipped the last one i would think he needed to go to this one if i went to the last one i would go home even if my colleague did not i would prioritize my personal life over a networking event i would consider talking to my manager privately but it would depend on what kind of relationship i had with the manager i would assume he would not want to publicly admit his mistake i would question whether i might be wrong about his feedback i would maybe reconsider keeping such a high pressure job i would enjoy learning about norway i would find it an interesting and pleasurable diversion from the routine duties of my job i would be interested in travel but not disappointed if i did n't get to visit norway i would hope that my initiative in learning about norway and its culture might lead to a promotion or raise
i will try to talk to the co worker i would try to reason with them hopefully with the intent to come to a compromise i would also consider altering my schedule and potentially shaming the other co worker i would closely monitor what my supervisor is doing i would also make sure i am up to date with my projects i would also make sure my supervisor communicates things to me a head of schedule i would go to the networking meeting introduce myself to many people and try to get the most i can out of thisi would discuss this feedback with my supervisor i would state why i think it is wrong with specific examples of why it is wrongi think this would be a great opportunity to learn about scandinavian culture i'm fine traveling to norway that trip is too long
i would ask who has seniority and be happy with the decision of the manager in charge thats what i would do as a manageri would do the project now and have it ready so that i could be prepare for whatever else my boss gives me so that i wont be stressed outi would try and convince my college to go but if they dont go i would go to the event anyway and try and network by myselfi would feel no type of way about it but i would want to know why my manager geels that way so i would request a meeting so me and my manager can talk about iti would find it enjoyable i love to learn new things and would find it very interesting and it might lead to another opportunity to travel on another project it they needed someone to travel
i think i could give up my vacation so as not to cause trouble at work sometimes it 's good to sacrifice our own interest for the benefit of the general interest with a little effort , i will try to re plan my vacation i have to mobilize myself to solve the additional task the boss has given me i can not let my boss do all the work and i stay quiet it 's always good to help those around you in this case , we can consider the boss 's request as an extra duty job i will try to go alone because of my qualities i think i will be successful at this conference i will try to be in good shape and make a beautiful impression i can not do anything against the boss 's decision , and i have to obey it the decision is motivated and worthwhile i will have to try to do better in the future and to perform all the tasks on a higher level for me it is a good opportunity to know more about this country , its culture and its people i do not mind this participation in this project at all i like to get out of my everyday routine and learn something
i would alter my plans to ensure i could vacation during the holidays since this is the only time i take a really long vacation if it was during the holidays i would shift my vacation a few days left or right but still take the same amount of time if nothing else worked , i would volunteer to telework on my vacation i would complete the project early i would do this to ensure i had plenty of time to complete it along with any necessary revisions this would give the the flexibility to take on another unexpected project if it came my way i would make an excuse not to go to the meeting i hate being in socially awkward situations like the one described besides , it is not a mandatory meeting so no once can force me to go if i do not want to i would be very upset i would ask to talk to my boss and have him show me documented counseling sessions that lead up to this i would express my dispelasure nothing in a formal counseling session for record should come as a surprise i should have known about this in advance and been given a chance to correct the behavior if it was really an issue i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about new cultures and places this would also give the the benefit of networking with the client
i would talk to the coworker and see if there is any flexibility since i have family plans if the coworker does too , i would like need to change my plans for another week i would try to finish the project as quickly as possible to plan for additional workload later planning is important so i would like to plan properly i would likely go to satisfy our client it is likely that our presence is very important and i would like to meet it i would make sure that my boss knows this too since it is a sacrifice i would try to talk to my manager to understand the feedback and counter it i would like to determine the source of the feedback and list counter arguments if possible i would like to get the feedback to be accurate to not affect my bonus or promotion opportunities i would find this very exciting i like to learn about new cultures and would like to travel there if helpful i would be very excited to be involved in this project to both help the deal and learn somethings about norway
i would talk with my supervisor and explain that i had requested the vacation first i would ask if it was possible for the other colleague change their vacation for the next week so i could keep my vacation the same i would do my best at completing all the tasks if i needed help , i would ask another worker to help me so i can get everything done in time i would convince my colleague to go i would inform them that there could be a possible chance of earning more money by meeting with the large clients i would feel upset that my manager has given me negative feedback that i dont agree with but i would continue to do my best and hope my manager approves i would find this project enjoyable being able to travel and expand my working experience would be something i would like to do
if my scheduled vacation can be altered with not much inconvenience to the people involved , i can always just give in it will be easy if my family friends are not involved i always adjust as much as possible i always start projects as soon as possible i hate procrastinating a job needs to be done right away in case there are problems that may come up i would go to the meeting with one of our largest clients i can go alone if i have to it is not important if i do n't know anyone there i would definitely speak up it is important to me to know why i received such negative feedback it is the only way i can make sure not to make the same mistakes i will surely find this experience enjoyable i like challenges but i do not like to travel this is perfect
i would talk to my colleague about it , especially if i was the one who made the plans first if i did not make my plans first , then i would try to be flexible and plan for vacationing at a different time but if this was a colleague that i did n't like , then i would not cave under any circumstances whatsoever i would stay focused and continue working hard on the project i would use the last minute tasks and side projects as small breaks while i maintain focus on the major project that is due to the extent possible , i would also ask my boss to give me the other tasks as early as possible i would go this sounds like a great opportunity why does it matter if i do n't know anyone else there \? the whole point is to network if the feedback has such serious consequences then i would talk to my manager about it i would want to understand why my manager feels negatively about my work i would also want to have an opportunity to present my perspective and explain why i have a different assessment of my achievements i would be very excited by this i love working with people from around the world , and i love learning new languages and cultures opportunities like this are my dream
it would honestly depend on what i was taking the vacation for and how much i had already committed in the most relevant case , i have 2 weeks blocked off for a wedding in the uk in august that i already have everything arranged for i would bring the tickets , hotel reservations etc to show how much i had already put into this and refuse to budge i feel like the way this is worded , i had mine in first so they can get over it i would try to get as much of it done while i did n't have a lot of work if the boss is known to give last minute assessments , i 'd run under the assumption he will do that again the worst case scenario here is that i get my work done early i would probably still go it would be a short term sarcifice for long term benefits honestly , i would probably use the extra time and effort put in as an excuse to treat myself outside of work later on i would likely try to counteract the feedback if i had enough concrete evidence to back up my claims if not \? i honestly do n't know i would probably still try to prove him wrong but i would n't hope for much i would find it enjoyable , because i love finding stuff out about new cultures plus , just because it does n't necessarily involve travel now does n't mean it wo n't later and if i'm already on the team that puts me into prime palcement for any travel needs that come up with this client
i would probably change my vacation plans to a week that would work for everyone i would not want to put my supervisor in the lurch , and it seems as if my colleague had unchangeable plans therefore , it seems easiest to change my plans i would complete the project as quickly and efficiently as possible this way , if my boss gave me a task last minute , i would not feel the time crunch i think since my workload is light now , i should take advantage of the free time by focusing on the project that 's due soon i would still go to the networking meeting i think this meeting is beneficial to my career , and it would be beneficial in maintaining the relationship between me and my biggest client though i would be a bit out of my comfort zone , it is worth it in regards to the development of my career i would feel upset and angry i would probably want some reasoning behind why i received the feedback i would also try to explain why i don t agree and provide examples that negate the negative feedback i would find this enjoyable , as i like to learn about cultures and countries that i am not familiar with i would volunteer for this particular task , as it sounds interesting
if my plans were easily changed i would consider it otherwise if i had requested the time first i would be unwilling to change i would insist on having my time offi would devote lots of time to getting the majority of the work done early on then i would be able to take my time finishing up the details i would be able to finish my other work as welli would probably try and talk one of my other colleagues into going with me if i could n't get anyone to go i probably would n't go either unless it was a very very important meeting , it probably would n't be work going alonei would feel very upset and that i was n't being treated fairly if i could , i would come back with proof to the contrary and have another discussion with my manager i needed , i would go over my managers head and talk to someone higher up it would find it interesting i enjoy learning about other cultures and especially if i did n't have to travel unless i wanted to
i would see who asked for the vacation first if it was him i would take a vacation another time if it was me i would suggest it should be to take the vacation first since i asked first it is only fair if we cannot come to an agreement i would be open to some sort of contest and the winner gets the first vacation i would talk to my boss and let him her know that i have a tight schedule coming up i would let them know that i am usually always up for a task but i can not handle it until my project is finished i would go in with high hopes and good spirits i would try to encourage them and suggest if they do not go they may regret not going i would tell them i will repay them with dinner , drinks or a favor in return in the future if they still say no i did all i could and just go alone with no ill feelings i would be very upset and try to cool down for the day maybe at the end of the day or the next day i would try to explain to my boss on why i think i did a good job and explain my reasoning if he still thinks i did a bad job i will explain to them i will do it his way or a better way next time and inquire about the consequences of the feedback if he still thinks there should be consequences i may quit depending on the situation i would find it very enjoyable i would like to research about the country and it will give me something constructive to do in my spare time i would also see if traveling in an option and be willing to travel there if i could be compensated but otherwise still be happy about the research
i would change my vacation dates if at all possible to accommodate my colleague this makes me appear to be a team player which is a good thing to be at work it also makes me appear to be more flexible and helpful and all of those other traits that are looked upon favorably unless my vacation plans were made far in advance and involve non refundable tickets that would cause me to incur a large expense or miss an important occasion if that is the case , i would make the boss earn his paycheck and hope for the best i would try to manage my time and make steady progress toward completing the project early this way , if my judgement was off and it is more time consuming than i initially thought , i should have time available to complete it on time if something else comes up unexpectedly , it wo n't interfere with my ability to complete this project on time i would find an excuse not to go that is the truth i am uncomfortable in networking situations to begin with so if my colleague was going to be the only person there that i knew i would surely duck out i usually try to make up for my lack of social networking abilities with other skills first , i am not happy so i would pause and reflect on the situation and my options rather than react immediately at least i would try i would try to wait until the next day but not longer and then meet with my manager in private to ask questions about the specific behavior that was observed and try to be sure that it is fact based and not anecdotal or just opinion or hearsay if there are facts to support the negative feedback i would try to accept that and commit to improving if there are not facts , i would try to make my manager see that and reconsider his her position i would find this opportunity interesting and enjoyable i like to learn about other countries and cultures i have had the opportunity to travel extensively for business and find that american culture is not the only way to live i have found other cultures to be quite interesting
i would take a different week i do not mind as long as i get time off i think our time is better used on work instead of further discussing this i would try to finish up early in anticipation of last minute assignment it is best to increase my workload leading up toe the due date i will give myself a couple of days before the due date to have the project presentable i would go to the networking meeting i need to get conversant with others so my colleague no not the only person i know at events i lean towards going because i am sociable i would try to address the feedback with my boss and hr i need to know why my performance is not accurately represented during this evaluation process i would not accept some negative feedback that are not warranted i would volunteer i would find this experience enjoyable i like travelling especially to elevate my cultural knowledge
i would select another week for vacation i want to keep in good standing with my supervisor and my coworkers i would focus upon completion of this project as soon as possible i would want to finish it soon since i would want to be able to complete any other last minute tasks i want to do my best work i think it is important that someone attend since it is a networking meeting if my colleague is not going then i would have to go it is important to support my company i would feel bad i would prepare a summary of my accomplishments i would see my manager and discuss the feedback i need my annual bonus for supporting my family i would find this experience enjoyable i like to learn about other countries and cultures i do not know much about norway
i would be flexible i would state my case strongly only if i had nonrefundable plans i would try to accommodate this one time i would work hard on the project right now i would do as much as i could first when i had time i would assume there might be a last minute request i would ask them to please come with me if not , i would be brave and go alone this is a worthwhile event i would feel bad about this i would schedule a follow up meeting at this meeting i would make a calm and logical case for why i disagreed but also how i would address my weaknesses i would love this i love to learn about other countries i 've been to denmark so would want to learn more about norway
i would change my vacation if i had n't put any money down that i would lose it would be annoying that my coworker was not budging , but i do n't think it is that big of a deal it would also make me look like i am willing to work for the betterment of the company i would work on it immediately and get it over with i would n't want to be struggle to meet deadlines if some other work came in i think my boss would think highly of me to have worked on it now , so that i would have the time to tackle the later projects without rushing and risking making a mistake i think working on it early would show i was organized and efficient i would try to convince my colleague to go with me i would explain it could be good for business and our jobs i would also talk about it being fun if we do it together i would be upset and would want to make sure i really understood the situation i might not agree , because i do n't fully understand everything i would have a long conversation with my manager so that i could prevent doing this again in the future i would hope my boss would see i cared and was open to discussion and would n't hold it against me , but would realize that i am trying to do a better job i would enjoy it i like to learn about other countries cultures i would be eager to communicate with an overseas partner so i could learn more about them i would also secretly hope i would have an excuse to visit them so i could travel i think it would be enjoyable
i would take the time to research who has seniority between us if it is me , i would present the fact to my supervisor and suggest that the employee with seniority gets first choice in vacation if it is not me , i would research who presented the vacation request first it it is not me , i would take my vacation at a different time and let the matter go i would begin this project as soon as possible i would want to complete the project in a timely manner in case other tasks come up that may take more of my time i would try to complete the project early if possible i would go to the network meeting alone if my colleague does not go i would not let the chance of not knowing anyone at the meeting keep me from going i may learn valuable information and meet new people i would respectfully present my disagreement to my superior with my reasoning and ask for a resolution i would ask my superior to discuss this manner with me and show me how the negative feedback was calculated i would let me superior know that i am very concerned with always doing my best at work and want to know about my performance i would find this experience enjoyable i would have the opportunity to show my diversity and ability to try new things i would be experiencing communication and knowledge about norway that i might not outside of work i would be expanding my contacts and might be preparing for future travel
he 's not willing to change his schedule that just says he 's the type who 's not willing to cooperate with others there is very little i can do here but to appease him and hope i do n't have to work with him on anything hopefully the boss noticed it and values my willingnessi would finish the task at hand as soon as possible just in case late assignment comes around since the work load is light i wo n't have any problems finishing the project finish the project and sit on iti 'd go even if my colleague is n't going the entire point of the networking is to meet new people i do n't have to be with a colleague to meet new people on my own i would confront him about it cautiously i 'd voice my opinion on how i view my own performance and suggest that i be reevaluated or at least try to get the bonus backi would love going to norway i always wanted to go and this is a perfect opportunity i would volunteer to go and enjoy my time there thoroughly
i would take the opportunity to allow him this week i would then adjust my schedule to vacation some other time i do n't need a specific time to vacation i would get the project done as soon as possible and enjoy my free time afterward if my boss gives me more tasks i can do them if there are no more tasks to be done i can continue to enjoy my free time i would not go to the networking meeting for i already had a long day at work even if my colleague would be going i would not go either way i like to keep my work and life separate i would challenge the manager i believe i should n't receive feedback that is untrue any consequences from dishonesty would be made sure to be corrected i would find the experience enjoyable i like learning new cultures the option of not having to travel increases my interest
i would try to discuss how important stuff my colleague will be doing in that vacation if it is something important and personal , i would change the plani would try to work on this project after hours as well so that it will be delivered in time and i dont have any extra last minute pressure i would try to attend the meeting for sometime so that i will be able to meet other people and socialize with them i would try to have my manger reconsider the feedback which is not the one i was expecting and would love to go with senior management with this topic it would be enjoyable to to be a part of this deal and learning new things about the country and their culture
i would discuss with the colleague whether one of us has travel plans that could not be changed , such as pre purchased plane tickets if he has such arrangements i would yield to him and change my vacation time if i had such arrangements i would argue my case to persuade him to let me take that week if neither or both of us have such arrangements , i would suggest that whoever submitted a vacation request first should get the time i would continue working diligently on the project as planned if my boss were to assign a time consuming last minute task , i would tell him that i have a lot on my plate already and a strict deadline to meet for a project i would offer to work on the task if i could be given time to work on it after the project deadline i would get freshened up and go to the meeting in this situation it is good to make a good impression on the client additionally , it will give me the opportunity to meet new people which often leads to productive connections i would ask to discuss the situation in more detail with him sometimes it is important to understand both sides of a situation to ensure that the perception of the situation is correct if i have truly made a mistake then the feedback may be difficult to accept but in the long run would be beneficial regarding the consequences , i would negotiate for a plan of action that would allow me to retain the bonus if successfully completed i would find this experience to be enjoyable it is fun and interesting to learn about different cultures with a busy schedule travel can be inconvenient anyway i think this would be a fun project to work on
i would agree to have whatever vacation time would be convenient for everyone else \( i have no family \) my last vacation was may , 1988 why complain \? i have no sick leave or other days off \( i work six days a week as a usps contract mail carrier , and am considered to be self employed , although paid by the usps ! \) i would begin the task immediately i would try to finish the job as quickly as possible , to make room for any other work load planned by the boss it 's best to do bad jobs first , and get them out of the way as quickly as possible i would go , is compensated if this was part of my job duties , i would do it besides , with me being the only representative of my company in attendance , i 'll be free to say and do whatever i please , to build up my own status etc i would be very angry i would send a letter to my boss 's boss , with a copy of his criticism , and my response to each point of criticism \( just for the record \) , and then counter each complaint with my own defense i would agree to the task although my ability to speak foreign languages is poor , my reading and writing skills have always been high i already know quite a bit about norway i just hope they do n't want me to eat lutefisk \( whitefish soaked in lye , then cured pickled ! \)
i would talk to my coworker about their vacation plans i would see if there was a compromise that we could come to mutually so that we could both have time off even if it was n't exactly what we both wanted if there was no way for the coworker to change their plans , i would see if there are alternative ways to have coverage i rarely take vacation time and when i do my plans are pretty much set i would point out to the boss that i work every holiday and rarely ask for specific vacation time , do everything i could to cover the time with either the coworker in question or possibly fill ins and still take the time off i would work on this project as diligently as possible even though there is extra time now , i am used to getting extra tasks regardless of the workload , i should always work to complete projects before deadline anyway if at all possible this scenario would not be a problem for me as i would still work as quickly and efficiently as possible regardless of workload overall i would go to the networking meeting whether the colleague goes or not i would actually prefer if the colleague not go this would allow me an opportunity to shine without competition from another not knowing anyone is a non issue for me as this is not just going out in public alone , this is networking for work purposes there is a common thread of the work to discuss so i would be fine outperforming my colleague and be sure to point it out on my next performance review i would step back and take an objective look at the situation if i had concrete evidence as to why i am correct and the manager is incorrect i have no problem going above them however , if i did not have concrete evidence i would have to suck it up and accept their response this is one of the issues with the corporate world , you must always have concrete evidence to back things up as long as you have that evidence , you are golden if i have that evidence , i could even end up with the job of my manager because the ones above would see the evidence and realize that i am one who values details and supporting factors i would find the experience enjoyable i do n't know much of anything about norway and am always looking to learn new things also , it would make me look better in the eyes of the company someone who volunteers for new things is seen as a go getter who wants to advance
i would talk to my colleague personally i would see if we could come to an agreement together maybe we can switch off and reschedule some things to make it work in everyones favor i would start on the project instantly since my workload is getting lighter and my boss is known to give long tasks , i would not want to risk rushing i would like to have it done in an efficient manner i would ask my colleague to go with me maybe offer dinner on me to make it sound more worth their while hopefully that would be convincing enough it would make me upset i would talk to my manager personally i would be professional and respectful to see what i could do to better or change my performance i would find this experience enjoyable i would volunteer to do this i find learning new cultures to be extremely interesting
if my plans were flexible and i had no reservations that could not be rescheduled , i would change my vacation time if i had already made commitments that would cause me to lose out on opportunities or lose deposits , i would point this out to my colleague and ask if they were under similar constraints if they were unreasonable , i would appeal to my supervisor i would plug steadily at it , getting all the structural groundwork out of the way first i would then continue to devote my available work time to it on a steady basis and i would prioritize the most fundamental parts of it , and leave the less vital parts till the last so i could cut corners on them if necessary i would also point out the detrimental effects of any additional last minute tasks i would not go , and would encourage my colleague to follow their inclination to go home as well the more people who opt out , the more cover there is for everybody and the more widely any blame has to be shared \( and the more thinly spread ! \) i would not do it because my job exists for the sake of my life , not the other way around my home is n't just a place where i hang on a hook waiting for my boss to use me i feel violated i am in an unequal power relationship with someone who has the unilateral ability to affect important aspects of my life but i am not in an equal position to question or challenge them , or to be equally believed by the people they 're reporting to i would express my own interpretation of my actions to them , and put my reaction on the record for third party review boring i 'd like to know more about norway , but not necessarily to devote a huge block of time to it and especially not so much of my time it would be to the exclusion of other things besides , most of the stuff i learned would probably be about the business aspects , which would be boring
i would insist on my vacation being granted over my colleague 's because i 've been there longer and had brought this up 3 months before said date instead of a week or two i would break this project down into smaller , doable chunks and knock those chunks out as time allowed i would really take advantage of this down time to get the ball rolling i'm not going to begin with you do n't tell me about an event at the last minute and expect me to participate edpecially if i'm not getting paid for my time i would defend myself and provide proof i refuse to allow someone 's opinion to get in the way of my success i would find this enjyoable because it would break the monotony of my every day routine also , i love learning about different cultures
i would change my vacation i am not interested in causing a problem at work with another teammate i do n't feel like its a big deal and there is no need for us to both be gone at the same time i would get this project done as soon as possible i do not like waiting until the last minute to get work done i do n't want it to be late and then me have such a workload that i am unable to finish this project i would definitely go to the meeting i would really like it if my coworker was going but if he is unable to then i am still going to go i will go and meet people and then i will enjoy the meeting i would sit down and think about the feedback i got from my manager i would possibly go back and visit with my manager about the situation and see if it was fixable or how the negative feedback came about i do n't want to cause any problems but if it can be fixed i would like to fix it i would be willing to learn some things about the country it maybe does n't interest me but knowing that my client is from there i feel like i would be more interested in learning a few things
if it was already a paid vacation or something important with family members , i also would n't be willing to budge the employer in this case must ask someone else to work overtime to compensate there should be enough employees or one that is willing to work in this situation my vacation is just as important as the other colleague depending on how quickly i can do the last tasks , i would set priority obviously as the days get closing to the due date of the project i would shift all responsibility on the project until it is complete i would still go , it may be an opportunity to get to know the clients more and learn more about them in some cases it may even be a set up for a potential promotion or working my way up in the corporate ladder i would n't mind going for this opportunity i would feel a little sad and angry that i failed to meet expectation and it would cost money in the long run hopefully i do n't fully lose my job and see this as a learning experience for my mistake and prevent myself from making it again in the future boring i am not much of a traveler especially in foreign countries yes it 's true i would like to visit my ancestors' home country in the future , but any other countries i have no interest in i never really also trying other types of food , i always have a specific food type that i enjoy
i would change my vacation i guess what choice do i have \? the supervisor really needs to go by first come first serve basis meaning whomever asked for the time off first should be awarded that time off now if my colleague asked off after i did , well they 're just going to have to deal with it i put in the time first i would continue working on the project that i already know about and have been working on i am aware that my boss gives me stuff to do last minute but as of now he she has n't given me anything what i should really do is dive head first into my current project so that i can get it done relatively quickly this is just in case my boss gives me something last minute and i can work on that to counter stress that it may cause i think that 's the most efficient outcome i would try and convince my colleague to go with me this is one of our largest clients and we should really try and accommodate them as best we can i would maybe offer to buy him a beer or dinner to reciprocate if he still does n't want to go then i would just go it alone i know i wo n't know anyone there but that 's the whole point of a networking meeting right \? i 'll get to know more contacts and further my career i would attempt to have a closed door meeting with my manager about this i mean , that 's really the only way to handle it i would politely and professionally ask why they gave me the feedback they did i would also offer several ways to change their mind about me clearly he she has opinions about me and or my work so i would need to try to change those opinions i would definitely find the experience fun it would help tremendously with my career to learn new things about norway and its people this sounds really interesting and hey it 's not the same old boring stuff at work it would be really fun to learn their types of cultures foods etc i would also totally be down to travel over there too
i would weigh my options if my plans are set and the specfic week is needed i would push for me to get the week off if my time is flexible i would adjust no reason to make things more difficult i would meet with my boss and ask for specific details after i have reviewed the scope of the project i would attempt to indentify areas that are vague or areas that s he might attempt to add more tasks to i would also work to have the project done by end of the first week to allow for additional work that may be given to me on this project i would try to get my colleague to attend if they did not attend i would still go it would be a good experience for me to go and be outside of my comfort zone the networking opportunities would be good for me i would feel upset and frustrated i would seek to get more input and clarification i would also prior to the meeting be sure to organize my thoughts related to the information i received previously i would find it enjoyable but more so if it turned into a trip understanding other cultures intrigues me to learn their way of doing business , interacting , etc would not only be interesting but also good for future business interactions
i would schedule my vacation for another week my colleague may have important plans for that week so , i would allow them to take that week off and schedule my vacation for another time i would try to complete the project as soon as possible that way , if other tasks are assigned , i would have time to complete those as well i think if i complete this project long before the due date , it would be less stress for me i would not attend the meeting if it 's been a long day at work , i would just want to go home and relax plus , i would n't want to go alone if i do n't know anyone there i would be upset if i received negative feedback that i do n't agree with i would set up a meeting with my manager and discuss my concerns then i would try to change my ways and make a good impression on the manager i would not find this experience enjoyable i would be concerned about cultural barriers and accidentally offending the client this project would require a lot of research on norway , which would be time consuming
i would take my vacation later on so i would n't cause any problems for work and so i dont cause problems for the company i'm working for i would get the project done as soon as possible in case any last minutes assignments came up so all of my work would be done on time i would convince my colleague to go with me , because i would feel really awkward if i did n't know anyone at the meeting i would confront my manager and ask her why she gave me bad feedback and i would try to explain my actions in a polite way to help them better understand why i did certain things i would find the experience to be enjoyable because i would learn something new and build better relationships with my clients
i would first try to convince my colleague and if he gave a solid reason why he is not willing to change his vacation plans , i will manage my plan as i want peace and i want to relax on my vacation , i would not be able to spend my vacation nicely if i took them under pressure also i do not want my supervisor to face any problem so i would adjust as i am aware of my boss i would take this project and i will give extra time i mean i would work more than 40 hours and spend saturdays working on that project so that i can give my complete attention to both projects and make my boss happy i would try to realize my colleague that it is our largest client and meeting with them is very important and i do not know anyone there , going alone could make things wrong , i would try to motivate him i would try to do more , one would ask my manager to have one to one meeting to guide me whats is going wrong from my side and what is expected of me i would do best as i would never want negative consequences i would surely try this experience as doing so would give me a chance to learn a new culture which sounds interesting to me and i believe it would teach me a variety of new skills it would be enjoyable for me
i would determine what process the company used for approving vacation requests \( seniority , date of request , etc \) if i was the senior person and or put in for it first my supervisor would need to follow the procedure for approving it and deal with my coworker accordingly i would focus on the project and get it done as quickly as possible , well ahead of the due date , as i do with all projects knowing my boss assigns last minute tasks makes this decision a logical one i would n't go because i 've had a long day at work i value personal time off and unless i'm being paid to attend , i 'd have to decline whether my colleague goes or not is n't really something i take into consideration when making my decision i would feel angry about the situation i would find out the specific feedback and reasons for it if the claims were false i would tell my manager that then begin the process of a formal grievance to correct this issue i would find this situation enjoyable because i like learning about new cultures i would think about volunteering for it if there was definite travel and extra pay involved
i would talk to the other employee and let him know that i also value that week for vacation i would expect that he would explain why it is important to him if he does so , i would probably back down and let the supervisor know that i'm willing to change plans to help the company i would make an effort to complete essentially all the work with days to spare by telling myself the due date is actually earlier than it is i hope to work harder and more quickly in this way i will be prepared for last tasks from the boss i would explain to the colleague that we can work better as a team and that it would be good business sense for us to both attend i want him to feel important and i also do n't want to get to the meeting without support if i am forced to go without him , i would make sure that i was well prepared and ready to pick up the slack , perhaps by goin over material with the tired colleague i would feel angry and betrayed by my manager i would organize my materials and demonstrate to the manager that the feedback was incorrect i would try to persuade him her that the analysis was faulty , probably due to the manager not having enough information , hand request to be reevaluated i would find it interesting immersing myself in a foreign culture is entertaining and often mind expanding i would expect that i will learn new things that could help me professionally and very likely on a personal level
i would change my mine i think depending on seniority the person who has been there the longest should get the first dibs on vacation days if i was there longer than my colleague then i would think they should be the ones to change their plans and not me seniority is best decision maker i would try to address the project as early as possible i would do whatever i could to get the hard assignments out of the way first other smaller tasks can be accomplished when i have more free time but i would hate to sit and have an assignment weigh down on me i do n't like to procrastinate i would probably go i am good with social situations even with people i do n't know whoever invited us to the networking meeting would be the first point of contact and from there i think i would trying meeting new contacts i think it would be a great chance to network i would do my best to take it in stride if this is going to effect my bonus or my pay i would do whatever i can to change how i am doing my job and following my managers advice if it continues to be a situation that gets out of hand , i think i would begin looking for a new job , without sacrificing my current job situation i would probably enjoy it anything that i can do that would add value and experience to myself is always good i can add this information on a resume and learn some things about how a particular client does business any chance i had to get my name out there as a go getter is something i view as a good decision
i would suggest that whoever requested the time off first be given priority unless for some reason the vacation ca n't be rescheduled , maybe because it 's been paid for already and ca n't be refunded if that 's the case , then i would understand and change my plans i would try to finish early because it 's always a good idea to finish things as soon as possible you never know what might come up , and it may take longer than you anticipate i would n't want to go , but i 'd have to weigh the importance of the client 's wishes with my own if it is an important meeting , or something the client really wants me to attend , i guess i would go i would first wait until i'm calm then i would compose a response to the feedback , trying my best to compile evidence supporting my opinions then i would schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss the issues i would love to have the opportunity to learn about and experience a different culture , with or without the travel i think it would be a wonderful experience
it really depends on the details and what type of plans i had made if my plans were flexible , i would volunteer to take an different week off it seems that my colleague is unable to change his plans since he is not willing to try , so i would try to work something out i can definitely understand why our supervisor won t allow both of us to take off , so i feel that i should try to help the situation by choosing a different week i would definitely try to finish the project early since i m expecting my boss to give me last minute tasks if i work on the project early i will have free time it will also give me extra time in case something comes up and takes my attention away from the project i tend to wait until the last minute to work on projects and i do work well under pressure , but i feel that finishingnthe project ahead of time is the more logical choice i would try to convince my colleague to go so that they i wouldn t have to go alone if my colleague doesn t want to go , i would probably go anyway it would give me a chance to talk to my clients and feel that it would be better to go alone than to skip the entire meeting i would try to talk to my manager and find out why he she gave me negative feedback i feel that it would be important talk to him her since i could lose my job or bonus and maybe there is some type of misunderstanding i would tell him her that i would work my problem areas and try improve i would definitely try to be calm since arguing would backfire i would find this experience enjoyable i like learning about different cultures and countries i definitely like researching and learning new things i like to break the normal routine and change things to keep life from being boring
i would talk to my colleague i would ask her what her plans were and how firm they were if she is unable to change her plans , i would change mine i would get started right away i would finish it as soon as possible when finished , i would look for something else to do if not assigned to something else it 's important for me to be there for my largest client i would try to persuade my colleague to go with me regardless , i would go i feel very disappointed i would ask for clarification from the feedback giver if legitimate , i would change my behavior , if not , i would object and clarify it would n't matter to me one way or another i do enjoy learning about other places if that 's what i need to do , i would do it happily
i would try to reach some sort of compromise assuming no concrete plans were made by either party , i would try to work with my colleague to determine an alternative time one or both of use could use our vacation for example , if he she is generally busier than i for personal reasons \( family etc \) , then i would likely look to change my vacation time since it would be more difficult for him her to find an appropriate vacation time i would try to do as much of the project as i can as soon as possible regardless of any possible last minute tasks , if my workload is light , then i should focus my attention on the project and not procrastinate this way , if my boss does give me last minute things to do , then i would have already completed a significant portion of the project i would try to tough it out and attend the meeting anyway as it is a networking meeting , the goal is to meet and market to new people therefore , not knowing anyone should not be a problem in addition , it is an important meeting as it is with one of our largest clients i would have a conversation with my manager i would want to discuss the reasoning behind the negative feedback and discuss what could be changed this way , i can understand his her perspective and he she can understand mine this way , i can get any negative feelings out in the open and show that i care about my performance i would likely find it enjoyable in general , i enjoy being given topics to research so long as i find them interesting the prospect of travel may carry some stress however , simply researching the culture could prove interesting
i would talk with my colleague and discuss with them about their plans if mine were able to be changed , i would allow them to take that week however , if my plans involved cancellation fees or something of the like i would try to convince my colleague to compromise i would try to finish up the project as soon as possible however , i would probably be a little more relaxed in pace in finishing it than i would be if i was rushing it for the deadline but because my boss is prone to giving me last minute tasks i would try to finish up the task sooner rather than later i would probably still like to go even though i was tired , i think it would be very important to still go because it is a very important networking opportunity i actually think it might be better going alone than with my colleague i could stand out on my own more i would feel very upset about the situation i am affected a lot by criticism , especially when it involves real consequences i would possibly try to talk to my boss in a calm way and discuss what i can do about it and possibly try to angle it so they can see my positive attributes and maybe not lose my annual bonus or whatever the consequence may be i would find this experience very enjoyable ! i love learning about cultures different from my own it makes me more aware of the world and enjoy it more i am enrolled in a global citizenship project at my college and would love to apply this at a job
i would change my vacation plans i usually plan to spend time with family i would just need to let them know i am coming a different week i would finish things up before the deadline this would leave me time to concentrate on extra tasks i would try to make sure i am able to work overtime as the due date approaches i would go because it is a great opportunity i would just tell myself i can do it i have attended things when i did not know anyone and survived i can do it again i would look at what evidence i can find to rebut the feedback i would contact people i worked with to see if they have suggestions has anyone ever had a problem with this manager before i would find the experience enjoyable because i like learning about other cultures i also know a little about norway and would love to learn more i would also think volunteering would look good for me at work
i would go ahead and switch my vacation i never make concrete plans before getting approved from work so it would be no problem unless it is something like a family reunion or something i would then try to compromise with the other employee i would go ahead and get the project out of the way , so i do not be stressed when the actual due date comes especially if i know that my boss sometimes gives me last minute projects even if my boss does not give me extra assignments at least i am done and can relax i would go anyway this is very important for my company if nobody else is going , i need to at least show up to represent my company i would try to network and get to know other people i would feel very upset with myself i would really have to have a look at myself and determine if what they are saying is true if i really do not feel that is correct then i would talk again with my manager and ask her to explain so that i could do better next time i would think that it would be a bit boring i dont get to travel to norway just learn about it i guess it would be a plus for me when talking with the company from norway but i think it would be boring
i would try and work it out with the colleague if that failed , i would attempt to change my own plans i would be willing to change mine in order to keep workplace harmony i would focus on the project due in two weeks if the boss gives last minute tasks that would interfere with that project , i would explain the situation to my boss i would attempt to find a solution that works for both of us i would go to the networking meeting anyway i would not want to displease the client i would make it a point to meet people who are there , thus not knowing anyone initially is not really a problem i would talk to the manager and ask the basis for the negative feedback i would also present my reasoning for the feedback not being true if the manager and i ca n't work it out , i would consider going to the manager 's boss i would find the experience enjoyable it never hurts to learn something new i could always go to norway in the future
i would not change my date because the colleague is not willing to change i would ask the supervisor to make the call of who to grant the vacation time off either that , or have me and the colleague draw out of a hat , in front of the supervisor the one who wins gets the vacation days if none of those tactics work , i would just take the days off without pay , and hope for the best i would finish up the project as soon as i could i would not set myself up for any last minute hijinks by my boss at the last minute it would be stupid of me to not be prepared for the unexpected get the project done early is how i would handle it i would somehow try to convince them to go this is one of our largest clients and it would be a mistake to not go i would make the case for putting in an appearance for at least 30 minutes and then leaving yes , we are both tired , but i would still go even if i have to end up going by myself i would explain why i think the feedback is unwarranted i would find out if there is anything i could do to reverse the negative feedback i would explain how the consequences could hurt my bonus if i can prove the feedback was inaccurate , i would seek help from other sources within the company i would find it enjoyable the reason is that it 's fun to learn about other people and cultures that may lead to someday being asked to actually travel there for my work or leisure
i would offer to change my plans if possible to accommodate my job i am usually pretty flexible with my vacation plans , and would not mind taking another week however , if i had plans that could not be changed , such as hotel reservations that could not be changed or tickets to an attraction , i would speak with my colleague and explain the situation to see if he she would be willing to change weeks if they still refused to change their plans , i would ask my boss to decide which of us would have to change our dates i would make a timeline of what i needed to do to complete the project by the deadline then i would share the timeline with my boss to ensure that he she was aware of the time i would need to do the project properly after doing that , i would request that any last minute projects that would require a significant amount of time or and attention be given to a co worker for the next two weeks i would also offer to advise any co workers who needed guidance on a task that i would normally take on , but be sure that my boss understood that my main focus would be on the project until it was completed i would still go even if my colleague did n't i feel i should , since it is one of our largest clients i would just try to meet some new people because that is what networking meetings are for if i did n't feel comfortable after i arrived , i would just stay for a short time , make an appearance , and make an excuse to leave that way , at least the client would see that i had shown up to represent our company i would be upset about the situation because i would feel that i had been treated unfairly if i truly felt that the negative feedback would affect my pay or position , i would go to my manager and ask him or her to explain to me why he she felt that i deserved that feedback if i still felt it was n't true , i would explain why i felt i did n't deserve it if i was satisfied with his her explanation and thought i did deserve the negative feedback , i would ask for help in correcting whatever i did wrong and show that i was willing to do better in the future if for some reason , my manager refused to explain his her reasoning to me or work with me to improve , i would go to hr and explain the situation and ask for assistance i would find the experience enjoyable and interesting i always like learning about other places and cultures , and this would give me an opportunity to do so i also think it would be interesting to work with a client from a different country , and possibly with some of their employees or representatives i think it would be a great opportunity to possibility to make some new professional contacts and learn some things that may help me in my career
i would , depending on how important the time off i r would inquire about who requested it off first , because that should be the only deciding factor those are really the only two options i would work the load regardless of it 's size i'm not the type to milk out an assignment this will give me enough time to complete any new work that is given i would carry on as usual other people 's choices do n't dictate what i am going to do i'm also not afraid of strangers , so going to the meeting does not frighten me if i truly do n't believe it to be true i would feel pretty upset about it i would wait for a good time or set up a meeting and confront them about it to come to some kind of understanding i would do this because it does n't seem too confrontational and it might get the dispute settled i find it neither i do n't think the experience would be enjoyable however , because it is traveling , which is eventful , it would not be boring
i would not give mine up either it may look bad but i will not be walked over if the other people are not willing to negotiate then either am i i would start working on the project today and everyday leading up to it if my work load is light now why not get it done if i knew my boss might throw a wrench in my plans it would be better to be prepared i would go the whole point of a networking event is to meet new people if they were the biggest client i could get good leads sure it would be nice to have a familiar face but it s not necessary i would go in there and ask to speak about it again i would explain why this situation is not right i would let him know i work hard and did not do those things that gave me negative feedback i would find it boring i would not want to learn a new language it seems difficult i would only do it if it included a bonus it just seems like a lot of work
i would change the week i plan to take for vacation i would guess that they 're unwilling to change because they 've already made reservations or have some other reason that it needs to be that week if i 've only just requested the vacation then i have n't made reservations yet i would ask the coworker if they would return the favor in the future if the same situation came up and i were unable to make a change i would start planning as soon as i have any free time if i have two weeks and that 's plenty of time , i would aim to get it finished with several days to spare since last minute tasks tend to come up then it would n't be as much of a time crunch at the end i would attempt to convince the coworker to go if they were n't willing to go , i would invite someone else , and as a last resort go alone it probably would n't be best for nobody to show up with one of our largest clients \) i would schedule a time to sit down and discuss my concerns with the feedback i would make sure it 's no sooner than the next day since being upset can cloud your judgment , and the next day gives more time to prepare talking points being rational and reasonable rather than appearing a bit upset is more likely to give a positive outcome i would enjoy the experience of learning about a new country and culture it 's always fun to continue learning about new things
i would try to take to him one on one to come up with a solution for instance if he wants to take this vacation this time and i will have to work , the next time both of us requests vacations on the same day , i would have priority this way i 'll take the hit but wo n't feel at a disadvantage in the future i would probably also talk to my manager to let him know that my co worker can take the vacation but that in the future , i hope that i would get first priority since the workload is light , i would try to get a jumpstart on the project doing as much as i can early on and hopefully finishing it a couple day ahead of the project , that way i can be ready if my manager gives me extra work also with me finishing this project early , it will give me more time to review it and make necessary changes i would try to convince my co worker to go with me but if i ca n't i would still go alone since it 's part of my job i would go early to make friends that way it wo n't be stressful once the event gets going i would get as much networking done as possible and relay everything to my manager and even my co worker who could n't make it i would try to talk to my manager one on one and try to explain to him what possible could have happened and that it could have been a misunderstanding i would feel terrible if i found out i had negative feedback and would try to correct it if i did something wrong if i strongly feel i did nothing wrong and my manager wo n't budge , i would get in contact with hr to find out what i did wrong since this carries a heavy consequence i would find the experience enjoyable i mean it would be great to get to travel to norway but just learning the language and culture of any different country is exciting it beats a normal everyday project in my book i feel like it would be a pleasent task to take on
we have to figure out a way to choose who was going to get that time frame i think the most fair way would be to go with who submitted the time off request first i would get busy trying to knock out that project get as much as i can done before any other work happens to pop up that way if i do have another work project i 've already gotten a lot of the initial project done i would still go to the meeting i dont need anyone else with me im perfectly fine with getting the work done alone i would open a conversation about the feedback and how i dont agree with it it is work and there should n't be any issues with speaking on work related issues it would be an enjoyable task it would be fun to learn about another culture and information about them it could provide more opportunities at work
i would say i am not willing to change my plans either i would then ask my supervisor to make the decision i would hope my seniority and or value as an employee would win me my vacation slot if it did n't , i would still abide by my supervisor 's decision i would get as much done on the first project as soon as possible if my boss gives me tasks that will take away from my ability to finish the project i would talk to her about it i would ask her to assign me some help to finish her tasks if she wo n't then i would make sure she \( and anybody over her \) knows she has jeopardized the first project i would probably go i do n't need to know everyone at such meetings to learn and contribute i would also probably also try to talk my colleague into going but even if she does n't , i 'll still go since i do n't feel it is valid , i would first talk to her about it and tell her how i feel if she ca n't convince me otherwise and wo n't change her evaluation , i would go over her head to her superior to protest the feedback if that does n't change anything i would seriously start looking for another job i would love a chance to do something like that ! i think it would be incredibly interesting i love learning about other countries and cultures if i were given the opportunity to travel there , i would jump on it international travel is my favorite kind of travel
i would try and let them know about my plans i would see if we could both rtake it at same time try and organize with clients i would do it well but also let the boss know that often i do not have the time to do such a work normally i need more time i am too rushed i would let them know that i would feel uncomfortable going alone i would need the colleague to go with me i would tell him to be honest i would feel very upset i would feel indignant i would try and ask the manager for explanation i would remain calm and see what they say yes i would i think it would be very enjoyable i do n't often get to interact with foreigners it would be quite the experience
i would want the supervisor to make the definitive decision i would hope that she would choose the person who turned in their time off first i do not like that the supervisor put the decision in the employees hands as that is their responsibility i would also make plans as if i needed to change my vacation just so that i would be an easy transition and i would not have to sacrifice my overall plans if i needed to change dates i would complete the project as soon as possible i would also make sure not to impose on my free time knowing my boss throws tasks out last minute i would like to plans as if they were going to give out more work i do not want to overwhelm myself in the end or be angry at my boss for the workload i would attend the networking meeting the point of the meeting is to meet and converse with others that you do no know i would be nervous at first but i do not want to pass up any opportunities that would come my way i also would hope that my willingness to go will help convince my coworker to attend i would be upset about the feedback i would take time to collect my thoughts before speaking with my manager and possibly hear if other coworkers received unpleasant feedback i would then speak to my manager i would first start out by asking why i received the feedback and then i would express the reasons why i felt i deserved differently i would think that it would be enjoyable it would help us relate better to the client it would also help improve my personal knowledge about norway in the future it would put me in a better position to be picked if they were to send someone to norway
i would just accept it has is , and take the next week with a but that he has to owe me a favor of my choosing like for a example switching a day of work when i need to call in sick perhaps helping me with an assignment that has a strict deadline or something of that nature i would organize the tasks in a schedule , and put a certain amount of time for each task of the project as well as pull all nighters even though , it 's probably not good for my health and if possible ask a friend or coworker to help with the side tasks that the boss throws in , and owe them a favor for helping me i'm sure the networking meetings would have people coming from major companies , so it might be easier than expected to look up their information i would research their information to find out more about them then see what kind of benefits the other clients have to offer for going to the meeting , it might help me feel more motivated to go to the meeting , maybe even convince the other colleague to go as well after reviewing the feedback , i will take down some notes , and try to prove i can do it try to talk to the manager first , and have him or her explain the feedback in question if i still do not agree or have proof of the facts in the feedback , i would go to higher management to help convince him or her otherwise , and show them i can do it yes of course , i would find this experience enjoyable , and perhaps even go to norway for future job prospects looking and learning different aspects of culture intrigues me , and part of me wishes i could experience them going and studying norway might also open up new doors for business opportunity at home as well
i would see how much it would cost me that is , personally or financially if the cost is high , i would escalate the problem to my boss i would get an estimate of how long the project will take based on this , i allocate my work level in any case , i would work hard on the project to get ahead in case i'm overloaded later i would encourage my colleague to go failing that , i would weigh the importance of going as an unknown i would most likely go and introduce myself i would feel insulted and wronged i would weigh the pros and cons if it is significant , i would escalate to hr i would enjoy it it would be interesting to learn about norway i would like to do business internationally
i 'd let my colleague take vacation i do n't vacation anyway it 's not my style i staycation but i can do that any time and i can find ways to cut my effort at work i 'd power through the project and finish it early , that way i could look busy while relaxing and enjoying myself i 'd go to the meeting , because it 's one of my largest clients that 's pretty obvious i 'd want my colleague to go , but if he does n't , that 's his loss and i'm using the universal he , my college might be female , i do n't know but the important thing is connecting with the client i would address that feedback with the manager , taking their point of view into consideration and expressing my own i would ask for clarification when necessary , and provide clarification when appropriate in the end , i think we can come to an agreement on what is and is not true i 'd enjoy it i 'd like learning about norway , and it would give me something non routine to do i like doing things that are not routine
i would change my plans as needed and cancel my vacation request i was in the air force , so i am used to putting the needs of my employer above my own needs when at all possible i would not want to create an unfriendly relationship with my coworker and it would make me look like a team player i would handle whatever needed to be done first and them work on the project due in 2 weeks i do n't like to have unfinished business so i would want to complete the project early so i could have time to deal with any snags that may happen with the project i would try to talk my colleague into going to the event if my colleague would not go , i would force myself to attend because i would not want to be seen that i do n't care about my employer while there i would take notes and try to learn information that could benefit the business , but probably would not interact very much if i did not have to i would be upset with the feedback as i believe it is untrue , i would ask for specific examples of the poor performance in order to sway the decision if it turns out to be true i would accept it and improve my future performance i would find the experience enjoyable although i do n't like uncertainty , i do like to learn how other cultures behave and would perceive this as an opportunity to learn new things i enjoyed my 2 years in germany when i was in the air force , it was fun to learn the german culture
i would first take a look at my coworkers and i relationship and depended on how that is decide how to move forward if i had a good relationship with that coworker i would save face and just choose a different week if we did n't get along so well then it would be a different story i would contact hr and determine who has the right to have it off first , what every their policy is i would make finishing this project a top priority and try to finish it in a timely manner since my boss likes to give me last minute projects , i do n't want the burden of this project hanging over my head not procrastinating on this project will ease my mind and let me relax i would think about the significance of me not showing up to this meeting , i mean how important is it truly going to be after thinking about it i will probably go without my colleague , after all being in situation without knowing anyone can feel awkward but can also open the doors to meeting new people and help with my career in the long run i think when you do n't know anyone it really forcing you to socialize which could lead to critical contacts i would be very upset , especially after putting so much dedication in my work i would simply confront him her and pry him her for more information as to why the feedback was graded as such if i could n't get anywhere i would simply then go to upper management or even hr to have the issue resolved so i could receive my bonus i would no doubt volunteer for this project , because other cultures fascinate me and i never let go a opportunity to learn something new it is always a good idea to take free knowledge when given the chance the only thing that disappoints is not being able to actually go to norway
first , i would talk to my partner i would tell him to explain each one why we are asking for vacations if i think his reasons are better than mine , i will change , otherwise , i will not i would tell my boss that i am doing well and i will finish the project on time i would also say , respectfully , that if he haves something additional in mind to tell me in time to be able to organize myself if it is something sudden , that considers the task that i already have pending to deliveri would ask my colleague to go with me , that we are both tired but if we are at least together we will spend better time if he decides not to go anyway , i would still go to the meetingi would talk to my boss to find out his reasons if his motives are things that i did not consider and he is right , i will recognize it and try to improve if i do not agree , i will make him know in a respectful wayi would find it attractive anyway , even though it does not necessarily mean traveling , that possibility will always be there also , to know other cultures is something that i like and , if at the end the trip is given , better also will show interest in the closed deal
i would see if there is a way for us both to go i probably already paid for a vacation so it ca n't be changed the company will just have to work with us i would speak to my manager about the deadline i would ensure that the manager knows to keep my schedule clear i would reiterate that i want to put all of my focus into this important project i would go anyway this is an important opportunity although i might be nervous , it is necessary to make these connections i would speak to my manager about the feedback i would say why i disagreed i also would ask that it be corrected for the record i would find it enjoyable i would get to learn about a new place on the company dime i also may get to travel if that becomes necessary
i would talk to the colleague and discuss our plans i would try to compromise because i want to keep peace in the workplace if i didn t have any set plans , i would take another week in order to make things easier i would work hard to do as much as possible in advance i would aim to have the project done a few days early so that i could attend otto any last minute take from my boss i like to be prepared and complete my work so this plan works best for me i would be tempted not to go however , it seems important for my career and the company i would go in order to make a good impression i would feel upset and betrayed however , i would put my head down and work on the growth areas and improve i would focus on minimizing losses in order to keep my job i would find this enjoyable it seems like a new and different challenge i would learn a lot from someone from a different country
i would determine who put in for the vacation first if i requested off first , i would stick to my guns and refuse to change my vacation if the other person requested first , i would schedule my vacation another week i would work on the project as soon as possible i would not wait until the last minute because if another task came up it could cause stress for me in my opinion the sooner i got the project done , the better if i did finish early , i could use the rest of the time to look over my work before the due date i would try and talk my colleague into going if they absolutely can not make it , i would still go going alone might not be ideal but it may benefit me in the end since this is an important client i would ask to set up a meeting with my manager i may also include any coworkers who could vouch for me that the feedback is not entirely true i would feel very worried about the situation but i would make it known that i was willing to do whatever it takes to prove myself i would find the experience enjoyable it would be interesting to me to learn about this country even though traveling is n't necessary , i would probably hope to get to travel to norway
i would make it look like i was terribly disappointed to give up my request i would tell him that i would not make a fuss about it if he would owe me a favor this gets me something for nothing i would approach my boss and ask about other projects i would tell him that i do n't expect any last minute surprise tasks i would tell him to be fair and get others to help him or tell me about any taks coming up right now i would go i would build up my network there it is after all , a meeting to get to know others that is no pro lem for me no introductions needed i would ask him how he arrived at the conclusion i would inform him that i will seek a higher opinion within the company the feedback would hurt me i know it could not have been so negative i would enjoy it i like to seek information on other cultures there would be no better way than this task
i would like to see possibility to reschedule my vacation if possible i'm a frequent flyer user , so changing schedule mostly wo n't be an issue for me aside from that , i mostly not making any major reservation until i'm getting closer to the vacation week i would like to try to understand the situation better that way i hope that i can get a better picture about what 's coming next i also going to try to communicate my work load with my boss to maintain the balance of the workload i would come to the meeting i might not stay long during the meeting due too the long day i had my goal is to honor the invite also show my client some respect by showing up in the meeting i would bring the issue up to higher management i assume that my manager wo n't be cooperative at this stage i also going to ask my coworker to testify if needed i would take this opportunity i 've never been to norway , and it seems to be interesting to be able to visit a country that i 've never visit before volunteering also give me a good opportunity to learn new things
i would probably be more likely to just accept that i cannot go that week i would first try and see who planned their vacation first however , i am more of a pushover and willing to make others happy , especially at work i do not like to upset others i would jump start the project the first day given just to organize and plan i would probably do most of the work between the first week and second week to make sure i had time to make changes or if something else comes up i would focus on the project first though i would first try and convince my colleague to go i would try and make an exchange that if they went with me now , i would go to another event they wanted later i would probably still go if they do not though , because it is one of the largest clients , which is a lot of business i would first be angry and leave the environment to think next i would head back and ask if my manager had a time we could schedule to discuss some things i would discuss each point that they made in their feedback and provide my evidence and counterargument in a constructive , yet neutral tone i would absolutely enjoy this i love the idea of traveling and i have never been out of the country i love to learn new things and explore new cultures and areas so this would be extremely enjoyable to me
i would try to discuss it with my colleague i would try to find some middle ground if possible i would do my best to reason with them and try to convince them by maybe offering to take on some of the shifts they do n't want i would try to get ahead of my workload i would set some extra time aside in case my boss gives me any last minute tasks to do i would prioritize the project and make sure to work on it before other things i would try to convince them to go i would tell them how useful it would be to attend this networking meeting if they do n't go i would suck it up and go despite not knowing anyone there i would try to talk with my manager more about the feedback i would ease into it i would present my points calmly and in a cool manner and hope they change their mind i would find the experience boring i think it would be a little pointless it just does n't seem interesting in any way
i would change my vacation plans to accommodate my coworker i would feel it is important to keep harmony on the team i would also want to demonstrate that i am a good employee i would start on the project immediately i would acquire the information , data , and resources required to successfully complete the assignment i would complete it in a timely manner in case my boss gave me additional tasks i would go ahead and attend the networking meeting i would feel nervous about not knowing anyone there , but i would hate to pass up an opportunity to meet new people i would try to be enthusiastic and excited despite any nervousness and hope to make a good impression i would feel very upset and frustrated i would speak to someone in human resources about the reasons i felt the evaluation was unfair i would want an impartial third party to hear both of our sides i would find it enjoyable because i enjoy learning about other countries i would be grateful that i did n't have to travel as it would be hard to be away from my family i would be excited to get to work with a client from norway
i would go ahead and change my dates i would do it so as to be the nice person willing to do the change in my bosses eyes as far as my coworker goes i would let her know next time thiis happens they change their date not me i would handle this project by doing as much of it as humanely possible right now while i have the time i would continue to work on it until the due date but i would just ensure im getting things done for it now while i have the time i would also talk to my boss and mention that it would be helpful if he or she refrained from giving me a lot of work until the project is over i would go for sure just to get my name out there and the company knowing im willing to go the extra mile for them i would be upset with my colleague as well and let him know it i will go though because i know i will find someone to chat with once there i would do my own research and request another meeting to go over what i find out if my manager would not agree to the meeting i would go to the bigger boss over my manager 's head i would feel irritated witih my manager as well i would find the experience enjoyable because i would be learning about a new culture i like to learn things and be seen as dependable at my job and someone willing to go the extra mile for my company
i would check with my family and see if we could move our vacation to a different time with reasonable effort then if so , then i would work with the supervisor to find another appropriate time for me to take leave at worst , i think we may have to cancel a few reservations if we 'd already made them , and be able to adjust our schedule i would take advantage of the current light workload to put as much time as i could on the project that way , i could either have the project finished well before the due date , or at least have little left to do if i was not to do this , i 'd risk having unexpected work land on me right at the time i 'd be rushing to finish up the project i would first see if i could get my colleague to go with me , emphasizing the importance of this client if that failed , i 'd try to get from my colleague all pertinent information about the client so that i could make a good showing by myself i 'd also get either from my colleague or perhaps make up myself a valid reason for my colleague to miss the meeting i would ask what specific elements the manager thought that i 'd performed poorly on then , if i had documentation that proved otherwise , i 'd make an appointment with the manager to show that documentation alternately , if i had coworkers who had knowledge that demonstrated that the evaluation was unfair , i 'd see if i could get them to write each a note to address the issue , then again make an appointment to meet with the manager and show the notes i would find this project enjoyable , but surely challenging it would give me a chance to learn about a culture i'm unfamiliar with , but admire though traveling is n't my thing , i may have to reconsider if an opportunity for travel happened to emerge , but i 'd enjoy the project anyway
i would request that the other person take off another time i might also try to take another week off i would look into what the supervisor wants to do i would start on it soon i might see what the boss thinks i should do i would plan accordingly i would determine how badly i want to go i would probably decide to be a networking junkie and go it would depend on how well i feel i would feel upset , but would seek more feedback i would determine what other people think i would talk to colleagues too i would be interested i relish the opportunity to learn about other cultures i would create a powerpoint
i would go ahead and rearrange my schedule and take the week off that my colleague refused who knows it might be show my boss that i am willing to rearrange my life for the job i would go ahead and knock the project out the way or at least get as much done as possible , because if my boss is known to pile on additional work , that means he she is just waiting on the perfect time to pile it on my desk they know what they are up to i would definitely go to the meeting it is the great opportunity to meet new people , network and build up a great clientele i would let my manager know that i disagree with their feedback , and i would request a meeting about the feedback with higher management i would love the opportunity to learn more about another country it would give me the opportunity hopfully to advance in my position as well
to avoid a bad stressful situation at work like a lot of tension with my colleague over who will take vacation one week over another and avoid creating a bad work environment i have no choice but to let my colleague have their vacation time and wait to avoid an argument with the boss and a bad work environment and risk being fired i decide to do task instead to keep my boss trust in me as a good employee i would go to improve my image with my company 's clients and it could help boost my career and get in good with my boss at woki hate the negative feedback from my boss at work especially if i work very hard will try to improve work performance but soon will be looking for another job i would love the chance to travel overseas especially norway to do business in that country , learn the culture and people help with project and improving my image with the company
i would consider first if it were possible to change my plans if i am able to change mine and they cannot change theirs i would accept a different week i would also look into who put the request in first , whoever put it in first should have the vacation slot i would also consider who has requested more days off in the past , if one has requested a large amount of time and the other none it would n't be fair to grant more time off i would get it done as soon as possible i would not want to deal with it last minute plus any additional projects so would finish as early as possible i would also ask my boss what projects or tasks they expect to come up later i would still go , especially for the networking i would take the opportunity to get know know the clients needs better and hopefully can their trust and respect i would encourage my coworker to do the same for the same reasonsi would give reasons why it was n i t true , supported by facts i would ask for time to rebut the feedback , explain that i can prove it 's incorrect while accepting the parts that are i would acknowledge the parts that are true and thank the manager for their time and explain my side it would be a mix for me i do n't like research but i like learning about different places i would be m i re excited i f there was travel involved i would accept that it could mean a promotion d o wn the line
i would try and compromise if possible if the co worker was refusing to compromise , i would compare our plans for vacation together and see who has easier to cancel plans if my plans were easier to cancel , i would cancel them first i would start immediately and do small amounts every day ideally , i would plan to finish early this way , if my boss prescribes me some b s to do , i will already be ahead on my project i would try and convince my colleague to go to the networking meeting if they did not want to go though , it would not bother me too much i would rather just go home and have a nice night in anyways i would try to talk to my manager first to see if there was a misunderstanding if not , then i would take an honest look at my work and try to improve if nothing worked , i would get some second opinions i would find this experience enjoyable learning about other cultures can be an interesting and enlightening experience i would be happy to take on more tasks at work to learn more
i would just change my vacation plans and tell my supervisor to cancel my request i would do this because i would want to appear as the bigger person and not be petty and say i'm not going to change my vacation dates i also feel like my boss would remember this situation and next time if it happens he would tell my coworker that he or she needed to change their vacation plans i would talk to my boss to tell him her that i work better when i have enough time to complete tasks i would explain to him her that i am confident that i can handle the project but it 's important tat i have the right amount of time i would also say that all tasks deserve to have a certain amount of time and attention in order to produce something that is of quality i would still go because opportunities like this do n't come often you never know what doors will be open if i go if i did n't go i would n't want to feel like i regretted it and keep saying to myself i should 've gone the fact that i wo n't know anyone else is n't a factor i would talk to my manager about how i feel i would tell him her that i felt like i always give the best i can on everything i do and how i do n't want this to impact the bonus i would also ask my manager to give examples of what i did n't do right so i can improve i would find this experience enjoyable because i love to learn about new things i enjoy learning about different cultures and comparing cultures , i feel like learning that will make you a more well rounded person there 's just something about gaining knowledge and knowing that nobody can take it away from you
i would base my decision on the plans i had made if it were possible to change my own plans i would it would forever color my perception of my colleague if i could not change my plans i would explain my dilemma to my boss and he he could persuade my colleague to change his plans if it were important enough to me , i might tell my boss i 'd have to leave his company off time is very important to me i would frontload as many tasks for the project as i could if i could complete them well ahead of schedule i would i 'd be prepared to speak to my boss to ask for extra time or a lessened workload as the deadline approached i 'd also make references to my need to focus on the project as new work arrived i would explain the position he would put me in i would explain how important networking would be for our company if he still intended to not attend i would go and make the best of it i would speak to his boss if possible if not i would make my intentions clear that i have no interest working for a company that intended to undercut me on false pretenses i may inevitably quit because i strongly value my own self worth and could not personally work at a company i thought was taking advantage of me in such a way i would enjoy the experience of learning about another country it would be an opportunity to show that i am a team player i have always hoped to travel so it may in the future open up that possibility
i would ask my boss if there is some way i can take two weeks off if i change my vacation if he says no i would tell my co worker i'm willing to cut a deal so i can take my vacation if that does n't work i would use my sick days on the same week as my co worker 's vacation so i ca n't be fired i would finish my light work early if i ca n't finish my light work early , i would but my light work aside to finish the last minute work from my boss and if the task is too big i would tell my boss i pass on it or if i can split the work with a co worker i would try to persuade my co worker to go if they say no i would go by myself if i go by myself , i 'll try to find another co worker or a friend that would go with me i would talk to by boss and see why he gave me the feedback if it is warranted , then i will accept it if it is not warranted , i would go to hr and find out if i can receive some sort of mediation over this feedback and tell them it could potentially negate my bonus i would find this experience cool i like learning about different cultures and with the internet it ca n't be that hard to find out a few things about another country since this could possibly lead to a job i may even take some lesson on the language so i can further impress the company
i would take my vacation i planned it and vacations are meant for relaxing i would not sacrifice my vacation week for my colleague i would do the project immediately i have free time and my workload is currently light it is better to do it now before my boss surprises me with more i would still go to the meeting networking is important i might meet people who can advance my career while i am there i would be upset by this i would feel the negative feedback was not correct , and i would talk to my manager about this i would not want it on my record i would volunteer to be a part of this doing the outside work would make me look good to the company it would be enjoyable because i would learn about norway and their culture
as a writer , i can take my work with me , and do n't mind taking some time during my vacation to keep up as such , this situation would not pose a problem for me since i'm paid by the hour , i would in fact welcome the opportunity to keep making some money while traveling i tend to do the work that is given to me immediately , and not stop til it 's done in first draft , so that 's what i 'd do here this means the reviewers would have plenty of time to review and provide feedback , so the end deliverable has a much higher chance of meeting expectations that would be a ticklish situation , and would probably be dependent on my relationship with the client team most likely , i 'd have developed some friendships there , and that would mean i 'd go on my own if not , or if it was a delicate situation , i might lean on my colleague to go with me ! in such a situation , the best response is to stay non defensive and ask a lot of questions to get the feedback as specific as possible despite one 's own belief , there is always something to be learned , and one can adjust styles in future work to better meet the manager 's style one proviso here is that if the feedback is not based on work but on organizational problems or behavioral rumors , it 's best to work through step by step and explain to help the manager come to a different conclusion i would love it ! i do n't know much about norway , although i read kristin lavransdatter , and have n't had the opportunity to work with norwegians before i 'd be the first one to sign up for this
i would probably just have to suck this one up not real sure here if my colleague is unwilling to change their vacation plans , then it appears i a m backed in a corner to where i would be expected to change mine at this point i am not happy but nothing else i can do i would begin to work on the project and try to see it through to completion if my boss gives me more work , i will see what the due date is on this project then explain i am meeting a deadline then ask for an extension other option maybe another colleague could do this one i would go by myself and the reason is the client is very big if i network with others , then i will get to know people associated with this client that could lead to more leads , and others i will interact with i would speak to my manager and asked why i got the negative feedback i would then asked how i could correct it and possibly ask for a 30 day correction period at the end of that i would ask for another evaluation i would find this enjoyable i think that learning about another country is interesting work habits are not the same all over the world it would be nice to learn about how other countries work together
i would be willing to change my vacation plans as long as they have not already been booked if they have already been booked , i will politely yet passive agressively inform my colleague that my plans are nonrefundable and ask if he or she would cover the cost so that i can go a different week if my plans are not set in stone , i'm willing to change them i would begin the project right away since my workload is light right now , there 's no reason to wait i think that waiting can cause me to risk no completing the project i would be willing to go i assume that since it is after hours that there will be food and possibly drinks i'm willing to go to something so that i do n't have to think about dinner ! i would ask the manager for reasons why he gave me this feedback i would politely discuss these reasons and the feedback i would tell him or her the reasons why i think it 's wrong and ask what i need to correct in my presumptions so that i am more correct in my behavior i would love this ! my wife 's best friend is from norway so i could take this as an excuse to bond over this i would even be willing to travel even though it 's not required
i would change my week unless i had made and paid for reservations if i had paid for reservations i would provide that information to my boss and my colleague i would explain that i would have changed my plans if i did not already pay for my vacation i would work hard on the project and give myself the goal to complete it in one week instead of two this way if my boss gives me additional tasks regarding the project i can work them in without feeling rushed if he gave me tasks not associated to this particular project i could concentrate on them completely knowing i have this one done i would attend the meeting as it is one of the largest clients i would make sure to speak to as many people as i could it is important to network with clients and they took the initiative to invite me so i would go large clients tend to remember who shows up to meetings like this and who blows it off i would take a deep calming breath and tell him i did not agree i would then begin to give examples of my positive work i would ask for specifics of what was done wrong and explain my reasoning for whatever i had done i would love a project like this norway is a wonderful place and i would enjoy learning about their culture it would be a great learning experience that could lead to travel in the future
i would change my plans , as i have the run into this scenerio just recently i was told that a pregnant employee was due to deliver , and i was , and have always been very flexible in my requests for vacation time i do n't have a rigid life that way i would attempt to finish it as soon as possible leaving things just because i might have enough time always increases my stress i prefer to finish everything as quickly as possible i would attend the meeting , being invited to an important client 's networking meeting is a privilege i would be fairly uncomfortable , but i know that i seem to come out ok when i am in groups of people i do n't know , although i tend to be a little quiet i would be angry , i would probably take it up with human resources i would potentially quit the position i am not certain , as i have not received negative feedback , but once , i was certain it was in error , but could n't convince the boss so i quit i would find this experience to be enjoyable , but sad it did n't include the travel i really enjoy learning about other countries , enjoy travel i would look forward to meeting some of the clients i would definately volunteer for something like this , although i worked in health care , so did n't have this kind of opportunity in my real life
vacation plans are often planned in advance these plans often require reservations , bought plane tickets or other transportation , and planned around events changing the dates around these planned events would be more than an inconvenience due to that , i would change my vacation time if i had no plans to travel i would tackle this project immediately there needs to be room for error nothing is certain or completely predictable i would remind him of the absurd times he had to write 14 paragraphs for one dollar further , that is a lot of writing with only 1 hour allocated he would certainly snap to his senses and come i would schedule a meeting with this manager to discuss the matter i would prepare for the meeting and bring all materials that support my case if the manager was not receptive i would consider going up the chain of command i would find this very enjoyable scandinavian countries are fascinating social , economically , politically , and have a rich history this area in the world seems to have the highest standard of living and would be enriching to understand it better this is an opportunity to grow my perspective of the world and people
i would involve the supervisor most companies determine vacation time by which employee requested the time off first and or by seniority if my colleague refuses to negiotiate then a supervisor must be involved i would attempt to finish the project early but not submit it early if i have the time now i would take advantage of that fact since my boss is unpredictable i would go to the meeting networking is essential for promotion and opportunities in most industries and my colleague 's decision should not influence my desire to advance i would arrange a time to sit down with my manager to discuss the situation if the situation could not be resolved , i would possibly go over their head to my manager 's boss if that did not seem possible , i might begin looking for a position with another company i would enjoy the experience i would definitely volunteer to broaden my horizons and learn about another country and culture also , the task does n't sound too difficult and i could earn favor with my boss for volunteering
i would first ask my colleague why they need the same week off as me i would then ask my supervisor which one of us has been there longer and deserves the chosen week more i would try and see if there 's any reason why i could n't change my plans and pick a different week my last choice would to offer my colleague cash or a favor to change their week i would first tell my boss that i wanted to work on the project , and to ask them ahead of time if there was any other work they had that would hinder me doing the project i would let them know that i wanted to do a good job on the project and that it was due in two weeks i would ask my colleague why they could n't go first then , i would ask them if they could tell me any information about the clients that would help me in meeting them like little things in what they liked , what to say and not to say , what are they most interested in just things that would help me out when going alone to meet with the clients i would first apologize to my manager to make peace then i would ask my manager if they had any advice as to how i could improve the situation \( job duties , attitude , performance that sort of thing \) i would then try my best to perform in the outline that my manager suggests i would first have to know what things i would be learning in order to tell if it would be enjoyable or boring but , i 'd look at it as an opportunity to help the company , and myself by getting involved in it
i would ask why they could n't change \( family , booked flights , etc \) and think about if it was possible for me to make slight changes if it was possible for me to make changes , and my colleague has a good reason i would go ahead and change \( to be a team player and helpful to my probably nice coworker \) if not i would plead my case as to why i should be allowed to have vacation that week i would also see if it would be possible to plan out work in advance so that we both could go the same week after all but if my plans could n't be changed i would definitely prioritize my own interests i would get started right away , from personal experience my real life boss is like this , and this exact situation has come up many times i have learned that i should aim to get projects done immediately , regardless of due date , as my boss does not accept that his sudden requests break my scheduling it is better to make slight tweaks later , if new info is received , rather than spread out the work over time i have tried asking my boss not to make sudden requests , but after 9 years i have given up on getting him to change i would think about the large client , how close our relationship is right now , and if going to the event will have a significant positive impact \( or if not going would have a significant negative impact \) i would be leaning towards not going myself , but if there was a significant reason to go i would plan to attend , but with an out \( if i know the client to be family oriented , i would plead a family event , or if work impresses them i would mention deadlines , etc \) i would be very upset , but rather than argue the point right there i would ask to setup a meeting for the next day or later that week that would give me time to think about the feedback , see if there is anything accurate in it , formulate points against anything i disagree with , and get data evidence supporting points for my point of view if the meeting did n't go well , and i was still certain the manager was wrong , i would think about why they might have said it \( bias against me , favoring another employee , bad info from a bad employee , etc \) and if necessary tell the manager i was going to speak with the next level up i would find it very enjoyable i was an anthropology major in college , so this type of situation is right up my alley i love learning new viewpoints and customs , and sharing mine i think this would be a great chance to improve my personal relationship with the client , while engaging in tasks that i find interesting i would n't mind travel either , if it came up , as i think traveling for business is a great way to travel , but cheaply !
if i have scheduled flights or events , i would also not willingly change my vacation plans i would leave the decision to my supervisor if , however , i do not have definitive plans , i would be happy to rearrange my vacation plans to help my colleague i would do my best to do as much as possible on the project as quickly as possible by doing so , i would leave myself more time to make changes and adjustments whenever my boss needs them to be made i feel more prepared by starting early and would therefore be less stressed and annoyed when changes are required i would go to the meeting , with or without my co worker networking is about making new contacts , so it would function well to get to know people plus , if my colleague is not attending , if i do n't attend either , we will have no representation at the meeting i would be upset with the feedback because of the repercussions i would write out and discuss my situation with my manager by writing up my account of the events , i have created a paper trail if there are questions later also , i have had an honest discussion with my supervisor in hopes of keeping the bonuses i would find this experience enjoyable because i am not fond of flying , but i am very interested in other cultures in this scenario , i can learn about norway in a very personal way i would definitely volunteer for this project and work diligently to do justice to the opportunity
i would just change my plans i am not picky if it was a specific event , i would try to negotiate or even do something for them to make up for it i would get it done as efficiently as possible even if i have a light work load , if work hard , get it done early , and then even if i am surprised , it won t affect my project i would go because it is part of my job i d try to convince them to go , but if not , it s just an opportunity for me to make a connection and help the company and my own career i would ask to speak about it i would ask why it is stated as such and ask how i could do better finally , if i still didn t agree , i might state my case otherwise , but i d accept the outcome and try a different approach next time regardless i would find it enjoyable i like learning about other cultures , so i d be all for it it sounds a lot more fun than doing real work
it would depend on whether or not i had non refundable deposits etc in place , and if i had requested off before them or not if i requested , for example , in january for may , and they requested during the last week of april for may , then too bad , so sad i'm not changing my plans if , however , it did n't make much difference to be what week i took \( if i was taking a staycation , for example \) , i 'd be willing to swap for the sake of office harmony i would go hard on the project now , so that if i get a bunch of surprise work from my boss later , i'm not caught without enough time i would also see if my boss could give me a clearer idea of the workload ahead so as to mitigate surprises if possible i would probably go i would want to represent the company and would receive brownie points for going when my colleague did n't it would be worth banking some face time with the client i would push for clarification with my boss , calmly and confidently \( not making a scene , but not being a pushover either \) if the feedback is bad , pushing back on that in a professional way is n't going to make things much worse , and might improve them i would enjoy learning about norway , and not having to travel for a long business trip would probably be preferable business trips can be exhausting , and if it 's not necessary to the role , my time could be better spent at the office
it would depend on why we each needed that time and how flexible our plans really were it would also depend on our seniority and past performance if all things were equal , or if my plans were less flexible i would want some sort of arbitration from hr so as not to put the supervisor in a difficult position i would do the project immediately so as to free up time for last minute tasks i always do things as soon as possible to avoid failing or putting myself into stressful conditions if i did n't get any last minute tasks , i would use the time to overdeliver on the project to impress my boss i would try to get out if it irrespective of what my colleague does i hate networking events and it does n't matter if i know anyone there or not the point of networking is getting to know others so even if my colleague went i would n't hang out with that person i would feel angry about the feedback and want to know exactly how i failed i would ask for the feedback in writing and i would answer each of the negative feedback points from my perspective i would then want hr to oversee this process and any action plan to improve on the areas mentioned i 'd love the chance to learn about norway and i 'd try to justify a trip there i love the excitement of learning new things and other cultures i would consider it perk to be involved in this project even if it increased my overall workload
i would expect my supervisor to make the decision regarding which of us would be able to take the requested vacation time in fairness , i feel whomever submitted the request first should be granted the time if i had already made any financial commitments related to the vacation time \( for example , placing a non refundable deposit on a hotel room \) , i would definitely hope i would be granted the time and would stick up for myself if my colleague had requested the time before me , i would be disappointed and sulk but would understand that my colleague should be granted the time in that case i would try to wrap up as much of the project as possible ahead of time i would try to allow for last minute , unexpected tasks to be assigned to me i may submit the project a day or two early if i am able to wrap it up i think if i aim to finish before the deadline , that will allow some flexibility for other surprise tasks i would definitely be unhappy if my colleague chose not to go i imagine we would be both be tired and eager to get home but networking is a big part of the job in many industries i think , particularly for one of our largest clients , attending this meeting would be very important i am shy in social situations and not terribly good at networking so i would greatly prefer to attend with someone i already know but i would probably force myself to attend solo if need be i would feel frustrated and anxious in this situation i would take some time to reflect on the feedback given and request an additional meeting with my manager i would want an opportunity to compose a response to diplomatically disagree with the feedback and provide evidence refuting its validity i would want to discuss ways i could improve moving forward to better meet my manager 's expectations i would find this experience enjoyable i have recently felt a renewed sense of curiosity perhaps having a toddler at home who is always asking questions has awakened in me a new thirst for knowledge i would love to learn more about a wide variety of things i would like to take up new hobbies i would love to read more , both fiction and non fiction books i would enjoy learning more about other countries , cultures , and ways of life i think this would be a refreshing and enlightening project i would go into it with an open , inquisitive outlook and i think that positive attitude would lead to a very enjoyable experience
i would also decide to not change my vacation plans i would leave the decision up to our manager i feel that it should be their job to decide who gets the vacation and who has to reschedule i would attempt to get started on this project immediately i like to always have more time available at the end in case something else comes up i also like to get things done early so that i do n't have the stress of a looming project weighing on me i would try and convince my colleague to go to the meeting we could possibly miss out on a lot of good business oppurtunities if we miss this i would not want to go alone though because i would feel anxious i would feel extremely upset and rather hopeless i would try and talk to my manager again and explain my side if that fails , i would then go to whoever was next highest in the management chain and ask for them to review the situation i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i have not had the opportunity to travel much in my life so i would be excited for it i would feel bad about leaving my children and wife for an extended period of time though
i would ask the coworker what he had specifically so we could figure out who 's schedule is less likely to be malleable , but also depending on company policy i might ask the boss to make an exception as most companies have a policy of asking for time off ahead of time in the end , i'm not confrontational , and if i could find a way to rearrange my vacation , i would i would spend as much of my working time trying to complete the project i would start with the broadest details and aspects , so that last tasks that come up should the boss give them could be worked into the end i would go as i am generally sociable i also see a lot of value in networking and would do my best to make some contacts that work out better for me in the end , i would benefit from my coworker 's lack of dedication i would try to schedule a meeting with him to express my disagreement with his analysis a scheduled meeting comes off as less confrontational in my mind and hopefully the boss sees it that way too , and we can figure out what went wrong in a relaxed setting i would be sure not to attack him personally , but rather highlight where i think i did things correctly i would love this opportunity as i love to learn about other cultures on the side i love to travel , and although this does n't necessarily involve travel , i would definitely focus on learning the information about my clients culture as much as i could
i guess i would change my plans if he refused i would be upset but i would hope that maybe my willingness to change would garner me favor with my supervisor i would hope that it would show flexibility on my part since my workload is light at the moment i would try and get as much of the work done early this way if something else came in at the last minute i would be able to fit it in easier i would try to be as organized as possible i would still go to the meeting it is important to go to these type of meetings so that you establish your work ethic in the eyes of the important people you need to learn to be on your own and meet the people who are most important i would initially be upset at hearing the negative feedback i would try however and meet with my supervisor to discuss what i could be doing differently i would let him know that i would like to know different strategies to work on i would think it would be interesting to learn the culture of a different country i also think anytime you can volunteer for extra things it will only help your outlook the boss has for you i would want to make sure my supervisor knows that the company is important to me through my volunteering efforts
i would hopefully be the employee with seniority within my company i would also ask to speak to my supervisor in private and discuss the matter with him her and see if we could come to an agreement i would bring up my previously stated seniority , my dedication to the company and the gratitude i would have for being allowed to take of for vacation if i was unable to convince my supervisor , my next step would be to persuade my colleague to change their vacation dates i would definitely begin my work project as soon as it was assigned i 'd hate to have another task assigned to me shortly before the deadline i would work a little bit on the project every day so i may even finish it earlier than anticipated i would definitely go to the networking meeting networking is and should be a primary focus of yours , especially in a professional business career even if i did n't know anyone there , i would make a point to meet and connect with others and hopefully convince my colleague to join i would be nervous possibly discuss the matter with a trusted colleague or friend and see what they have to say i like to think of all scenarios and opinions before making an informed decision i would most definitely find this experience enjoyable i 'd love to speak with and learn from a norwegian client i strongly believe in being a life long student and everyone can learn something from someone
i would tell the supervisor that the person that asks for the week off first should get it i feel that it is the only way to be fair i should not have to give up my chance just because they do not want to i would start doing some parts of the project early i would do this just to be ready in case i have other work to do and am not behind if i start early , i will have time to prioritize any other projects that come up i would still attend the event it could help me in the long run by making connections with people i would feel lonely at first but after talking to some people , i would be okay i would tell them that i dont agree with them i would not let them punish me for something i did not do i feel as is they are jumping to conclusions and not allowing me to defend myself i would find it boring because i would not be able to travel just learning about norway would not benefit me in anyway i would only accept the position if i were able to travel
i would ask the supervisor who requested that week first if it was him , i would change my week and make different plans if i requested it first , i would try to get that week off myself i would talk to the supervisor and tell him i was unwilling to change , i requested it first , and that i should get it i would spend as much time on the task as possible , so i can get it finished as soon as i can that way , if i get any additional tasks i will have plenty of time to complete them i would ensure my deadline was n't missed because i took it easy it would depend on how tired i was if i was worn out i may not go either if i felt up to it i would go though it would be an excellent opportunity to grow our relationship with an important client , and i am confident i can succeed without his help i would gather any evidence like work reports and records that supports my position and take it to the supervisor i would have a talk with him and present my case if i ca n't change his mind , i would accept it and try to prevent any other misunderstandings in the future i would volunteer it would be enjoyable because it would be different than my everyday duties it might also be a challenge , and help me improve my skills i would like it even more if i did have the opportunity to travel and visit the country
i would clearly asked for the days off first i will go talk to my manager to express this there are protocols to follow and since i asked first that means the days i requested are of top priority so i should n't lose my daysi would work on this product until it is finished i 'll do my best not to let the fact that i have a light work load slow me down i rather stay on the good side of my boss so that they can rely on me when needed and create job security i would go without them and mingle i 'll take this opportunity to get to know my client better and try to make a positive impression this will show my client that i take them seriously and will take time for them when needed i would request a meeting with my manager i will then request for him to explain to me why he feels this way so that i can understand better and act towards it then i will request he let me express why i feel that he 's wrong and request information on how to better present myself for the future i think that it would depend on the person if the person is n't the kind of person that likes to respond to others and have a conversation it would be very boring i would also prefer to to take them to the actual location so that they can appreciate the information and culture more
i would compromise by making sure the next time i would vacation , my colleague must work for me i feel this way because it 's about fairness , even though at this time , my colleague was n't willing to change plans i do n't feel the matter is serious enough to cause any kind of personal issue to the colleague for his action i would handle this project efficiently and effectively by making sure my light workload was completed well before the due date it is always best to keep ahead of things and even more so since my boss may give me last minute tasks either way being ahead is better than falling behind i would encourage my colleague to bite down and go to the network meeting even if only for a little bit , it 's worth making connections with one of our largest clients not doing so would most likely have negative impacts on the future with these clients it 's worth the last minute small struggle to attend i would be upset with why my manager gave me this negative feedback however , i would also look within myself deeper to maybe seek as to why or how i can do better in addition , i would ask my manager how he or she suggests i perform as well as what i need to do better at i would find the experience mixed i'm not really interested in learning about other cultures or countries , however , to look good for the company and my boss i 'd volunteer either way i feel volunteering is a good thing because the deal was closed with a client from norway which can only have positive impacts
i would change my plans to different week if i could i typically do not fly so if i could i would just change the week i went i would n't want any friction between us and would rather succomb to the situation than fight it i would gather all my information and things i needed for the project i would start it right away i do n't have to rush and will be able to work on it in my spare time i would not go we are both tired and after a long day , i simply do n't need to go i would n't know anyone and feel like it would be awkward for me i would discuss with him how i feel and get his perspective i would also talk to my coworkers whom i trust to see what they thought as well if i potentially lose my annual bonus then i would find out what the real issues were and fix them i would n't feel good until this situation was resolved i would definitely volunteer because i like learning about other cultures and different' parts of the world i think it would very enjoyable and would help me in the long run with other clients as well i could learn to help them based off of there needs
i would approach them about their plans assuming my plans arent as important as his i would cede and plan a different week if i view mine as more important i would sit down and express that with them i would blast through what needed to get done after , i would approach my supervisor and ask what else needed to be done they would have a hard time giving last minute projects having approached them first i 'd ask them why they werent going if it was a valid reason i 'd make do on my own if not , i would tell them how much i' appreciate their presence and ask them to reconsider i 'd feel a little trapped i 'd approach them about the situation if we could n't come to terms i would immediately start job searching i would love the opportunity learning outside of what my job entails and getting paid for it seems like a dream i would be disappointed if it did not lead to any travel though
i would change my vacation plans i would do this , because it could make me look good in front of my supervisor it would show that i am flexible and reasonable , when compared with my colleague i would start working on the project as soon as possible even though it is not due for two weeks , something else may come up that takes up my time i would n't want to save it for the last minute , and risk doing a poor job i would go , even if i did n't know anyone else there the purpose is for networking , and this would help me to get to know more people it could also help me make powerful connections that would help advance my career in the future i would feel really bad about this situation , and think that it is unfair i would discuss the feedback with my manager and see if we can come to some understanding at least by doing this , they would see that i am willing to make a strong effort to change and that i am showing interest in improving i would find this experience enjoyable , because i love learning about other cultures i would take this opportunity to gain knowledge , for my own interests gaining the extra knowledge could also help me gain more opportunities in the future , and could allow me to travel in the future , as well
i would look at how necessary it was for me to take vacation that specific week i would consider approaching my colleague to see if we could come to some compromise if i really needed that exact time frame i would do this because sometimes talking directly to someone can yielded different results than if you 're dealing through an intermediary in this case the boss i would go ahead and complete as much of it up to entirety as possible we all know how unforeseen events at the last minute can screw everything up so it 's better to be as free as possible in case the boss does indeed have a last minute job it 's always wise to err on the side of caution i would probably go since it 's one of the biggest clients the saying , keeping up appearances can apply here first , you 'd be doing your company by showing up and putting in the effort second , showing up could lead to future business opportunities i would call the manager out on this as politely as possible i 'd try to figure out why he she has given said feedback by asking detailed questions then i 'd do my best to evidence why he she is wrong by using as many specifics as possible i would find this enjoyable and would hope travel to norway would become necessary it 's always interesting to learn about different countries and customs and since scandinavia is basically separated from the rest of europe it would be cool to learn about what is a unique culture
i would change my vacation week i think it would show my employer that i am easy going , and that i try to do what is best for the company i think my employer would remember that when the next promotion or evaluation came up i would work on the project right away and get if finished before the due date if my employer decided to give me a last minute task it would not affect my current project because i have already finished it i would not be put under pressure right at the last minute like i would be if i waited to do the project until closer to the due date i would try to talk my colleague into going with me but if they did n't go i would still attend it would show my client that their business is important to me and that i am proud to be a part of the networking i think this would ensure my client that they have chosen the best company to handle their projects i would feel very upset about the negative feedback i would make a point to tell my employer exactly why i did not deserve the feedback that they had given me i would tell them that i have tried my hardest for the company and that this feedback could cost me a great deal i would respectfully ask that they would reverse the negative feedback for more positive feedback i would find the experience very enjoyable i think it is exciting to learn about other countries and their traditions i would be happy to volunteer on the project not only would it be fun , i think it would also make me look better in the eyes of the employer
i would have little choice but to change my plans in this case and would have to accept the decision of the supervisor in this case delivering a project isn t difficult what s difficult is delivering a project without first taking the time to plan properly planning for the unexpected is essential you can overcome your circumstances or you can let your circumstances overcome you if it one of our largest clients , i would have to attend even for a short period i would encourage my colleague to do likewise for the good of the company it s great to spend time at a networking event with someone you know and like but that s not what you re there for your goal is to expand your network by meeting new people basically , it`s your job and your duty feedback is essential to growth be aware of the difference between genuine and faulty characters it s hard to tell who is conforming to others opinions and who is speaking out of intellect and honesty to bring awareness to the people surrounding them i have always fought to be the latter the former has always made me withdraw from society success lies in absorbing negative feedback and making the best use of it i would find this situation delightful we do not need a degree to volunteer all it requires is a heart and willingness to serve when the company need`s you besides a new experience might be fun in the end
i would take a different week off i always figure out my vacation in advance of making travel arrangements i am flexible and my coworker is not but i would not care i would try to anticipate what my boss wants i would set milestones for myself i would cover my bases i would go to the event i would hope the people i know would show up if not , i would meet new people i would talk to my supervisor i would try to understand their rationale i would also come with evidence to make a case for myself i would find the experience enjoyable i would want to learn new things i would be excited about the opportunity
i would see if i'm not locked down to a date , i would take this challenging time to analyze and see why i am receiving restriction in trying to leave on vacation , maybe it would be best to go a different day anyway , call me superstitious , but maybe a different day would mean a different outcome for this vacation i try to pay attention to the signs of life , although it does n't always work i would try t get ahead as much as i could , eve to the point of going up to my boss and let him her know that i would like to help her with anything she may need now so i can get ahead start , otherwise i may be a bit caught up in a project i'm preparing for i would very much enjoy going out on my own i agree it may be nerve wrecking going alone and not knowing anyone there but that 's how you meet more people i am used to going to places alone so this does n't keep me away or from not doing something most of the time as a very passionate and also very reserved person , if i voice my opinion of feel rightfully wronged than it 's for a reason even if it gets me fired unfortunately it has happened i just do n't like to be persuaded to be a certain way if i disagree with it i would be so excited and secretly screaming inside with joy , it would feed the adventurous and spontaneous inner part of me i would totally take advantage of this opportunity and offer myself for travel out of the country , i am passport ready \) if needed to fully submerge myself
i would first see if my vacation is flexible and change my dates if i can i would then discuss with my supervisor changing policy for how vacation time is requested , so it is more fair next time i would suggest it be done by seniority and or first come first serve i would finish the project early i would anticipate giving myself time to finish last minute tasks i would give my boss a timeline and request last minute work early i would go if i was looking for a new job or opportunities you never know who you could meet at these events i would also look to see if they are having another soon to go to instead i would discuss this further with my boss i would do this without being confrontational i would also request how i can improve and suggestions to make sure it does not happen again i would find this enjoyable i like learning new things i would also love an opportunity to travel if i could , thought i know it is not required
if my colleague is not willing to change her time off then i will cancel my plan and will plan my vacation some other wk as my colleague is not just my colleague she is my friend too and i am willing to do that for my friendi will handle this project very efficiently and since i know my boss nature so i will try to do some of my project work at home so that it can be finished before it s due date and even if my boss gives me last minute tasks i will be able to finish it on time i would definitely want to go in the meeting and get would try to convince my colleague to come too but if she is tired after a long day at work i will not force her and i would just go there alone and would make some excuse for my colleague i would feel very bad about it and would definitely not like it in this situation i would go to my boss and talk to him about my performance and would tell him all the positive things that i did that year and would try to convince him that my performance was very good that year i think it would be a very enjoyable experience and i would love to be part of as i like research work and i enjoy learning about different countries
i would choose another week evidently that would seem to be the only solution i would hope that should that occur in the future , my colleague would be the one willing to change plans i would get started right away on the project so that i could have it finished by the due date knowing my boss might give last minute tasks definitely gives me a head 's up to get going i would go to the meeting alone it is a meeting with one of my largest clients and it is important i am not responsible for my colleague 's decision i would ask my manager to re evaluate my performance if possible if not , i would ask my manager to help me to become a better employee and not make the same errors i would find this experience enjoyable how often are you paid to learn about another country for your job \? awesome !
i would see what their reasoning is for the time off if it is more important than mine then i would switch if the person was just staying home then i would fight to keep my time off i would let my boss know that i have a full schedule hopefully the boss will understand if not then i may have to work extra hours to get my project done on time i would go it would be great time to meet the clients and get to know them better i do not care if i go alone it would actually make it easier for me schedule if i am by myself i would not be happy whether is was justified or not , it may affect my bonus i would probably go to hr to revisit the situation if the situation was very dire i would risk my job to get the manager in trouble i would think this was a great opportunity learning about norway would be a great task the travel aspect would n't be that bad if needed i would volunteer
i would change the week of my vacation i rarely had a time sensitive vacation i also would always schedule for the slowest time of the year i would get the project done as soon as possible this way any last minute tasks could also be accomodated it would just be a matter of prioritising any overlapping projects in an efficient manner i would attend the networking event no matter the results of this event , it would be known that i had gone out of my way for my company this should result in favorable comparison to the employee who did not attend i would begin an aggressive search for a new job while doing this i would continue to do my best at work and try to ignore the feedback that i considered so unfair there are lots of places to work and staying somewhere that demeans you is unnecessary i would most likely find this enjoyable something that breaks up a routine and also leads to new knowledge is good the possible option of moving to a foreign country is also interesting
it depends on my schedule and what i have planned if it 's something that i ca n't reschedule i would have human resources settle it someone would have to make the decision i would get it done immediately if my boss does that to me i should be prepared i do n't procrastinate anyways i would try to talk her into going if not i would go and try to meet people might as well try i would look into my recourse if i have an avenue of appeals i would look into that most likely it would be something i have to deal with if it involves some other incentive that would be something i would volunteer for i would be interested to learn about norwegian culture but there would have to be an incentive my time and effort is not free no one 's is
i would start by looking at who requested the time first if i had my request in before my colleague , i would not give in and i would keep my vacation time if she put her request in before i did , i would change my vacation dates if we did it at the same time , i would ask my manager to make the decision i would get it done as soon as possible even though my work load is light , that can change i do not want to end up in a bad place or pressed for time when it is closer to the due date i would first try to convince my colleague to go so we can both know someone there if they chose not to , i would just bite the bullet and go if it is the largest client , it would be important to be there and i would not want to miss the opportunity i would explain my side to my manager and see what their response is from there , i would ask to get a mediator or another superior involved to make sure that things are handled in an honest and unbiased way i would make sure to show evidence supporting my side and how the feedback is not true i would find this experience enjoyable because i would be able to learn about a new culture i would finally have a reason to learn about it since i likely would not have done it on my own free will i would definitely volunteer for this project
i would first ask my supervisor who had requested the time off first then i would talk to my coworker and get the details of his trip i feel as though the time off would be best given to the person who has more at stake with cancelling their trip i would begin working on the project right away knowing the possibility of last minute work that is possible would give me anxiety , so i would try and start the project and get as much done as possible i would still gain the courage and go this client is obviously important for work and i would take one for the team i feel as though it would be important to be there and show face so even though it could potentially be awkward i would put myself out there and hope for the best i would feel very upset , but i would turn this situation into a learning experience and do whatever it is i need to do to correct the feedback and show that i am a team player and listener it would be hard to swallow my pride but also i would have to think of the bigger issues at hand i would feel this would an enjoyable experience i also have liked learning about different countries and learning about different cultures it would be a good excuse to educate myself in something new
i would just talk with my colleague and try to tell him her why i need this week to go on vacation if that does not work i will try to make it as a favor to him like i will go next week on vacation but you need to make me a favor next time like this i would be somehow friends with him her and we would talk about it i would focus on the project first i would ask for some help from co workers and if something comes up , i would say to my boss that i can`t right now but if the new tasks are urgent , i would just put the project on hold i would try to convince my colleague that we should go and meet new people there if i can`t convince him her to go with me , i would probably find someone else that goes there i would still go and make new friends there and find someone else to talk about the topic i would feel bad , and probably mad at my manager i would try to talk with him her about this and convince my manager that i did a good job if that does not work , i would try to present and explain with facts that what i did was right and good for the company and i did a good job i would love to do this i like finding out new things and talking with people from other countries i would enjoy the experience and probably want to travel there its very nice to meet new people from around the world
if i did n't have anything planned , i would change my vacation i try to lead by example at work if i do this for a colleague today , hopefully they will do the same for another colleague tomorrowi would finish it a few days before the deadline this would allow me to take on any last minute projects if they come about if no last minute project comes about , i can use the extra few days to proof and perfect my project i would still go it is good to show your face at meetings such as this it does n't matter if you do n't know anyone you can simply introduce yourself and get to know others i would not argue with my manager i would ask questions about the things that confused me about her review if i did not agree with her response , i would still make it a point to try to change my work in a way to suit her requirements i would absolutely find this enjoyable it is always fun to learn about different countries it seems that this would be a project that is different from my normal work it would break up the monotony in my work routine
i would let them take the time off i would tell them that if we have this problem again then it would be their turn to step back it is not that serious i would just let them have the time i would just do it now i would try to do a little bit every day this way if i get unexpected work assignments i will be able to handle it it would be bad to put things off because i could end up in a bind i would just go regardless of what they decide i would just try to make the best of it this is an important client and it wouldn t be good if no one went i would do this because it is the right thing to do and it may help me at work in the long run i would ask for a meeting with upper management i would make sure i was well prepared before i went write down what was in disagreement and my reasons why i would do this because my career is on the line and i don t want any negative feedback to hurt me i would find this experience enjoyable it would be something different from my current job duties if i do a good job maybe i would be compensated for my time and effort
if we talked about it early enough i would shift my week i live alone and have a pretty flexible lifestyle i am also a libra and avoid conflict whenever possible a lot depends too on how long we colleagues have worked alongside each other , and what is the future of our employment here also , i am not really much of a vacation type person , seldom using the days allotted by my job each year even if i had to blow an evening or two i would outline the project as soon as possible like baking , my projects are better if they are completed as soon as possible and have time to cool before they are turned in when the big job can sit on the back burner a couple of days and i scan it again before i turn it in , i do a higher quality of work since i hope to climb the corporate ladder i do want to have this second chance to make a 'first impression' as the old saying goes so do n't expect me to do a last minute thrown together piece of work on such a project further , maybe that last minute imposition will give me a new insight to drop into the two week project as an introvert , i have no problem with this kind of opportunity i have no needs to charm the crowd but i do enjoy watching and analyzing other people 's behaviors an extra cup of coffee as i leave the office will give me several hours to survey the scene i might even meet one or two players after i have seen who is campaigning for their own ideas of course , i would be deeply disappointed by this development my analysis would start with trying to get to the point being made i have studied with the group at cnvc org for over a decade so first i would want to figure what were the feelings and needs of the manager in making the comment then i would clarify my analysis with my manager , asking for help in understanding the hopes and desires behind the 'negative feedback ' as a result of this conversation , i would hope that we could negotiate ways to satisfy my managers underlying issues without compromising my personal beliefs should this not be possible , i might have to look for another position i am somewhat like a data vacuum , so the chance to study the language , history and culture of norway would be delightful however , i am a settler not a pilgrim so under no circumstance would i who has no passport ever consider leaving my home town beyond studying the lay of the land , there are surely a variety of other ways to work on the project but it would be important for the principals on the project to know i do not travel
if i did n't already have firm plans i would give it up if i did have firms plans i would push the supervisor to decide based on who submitted a request first i would cram right now and get as much done as possible so that i would be available for last minute tasks i would not go those things usually turn into too much alcohol and no actual networking i would respond via email , possibly cc'ing my managers superior with a counterpoint to every negative feedback item and request a time for all of us to meet i would find it interesting i like learning about other cultures without actually experiencing them by travelling
i would consider changing my vacation week to some other dates i would try to find out why my colleague is unwilling to change his dates if there is good enough reason , better than mine , then i will make the sacrifice i would go ahead and finish the project as son as possible , even if i will have time remaining in my hands , i would rather get the project out of the way because the supervisor may come up with something besides , i would have more time to make sure everything is in order i would try to convince my colleague to come along it may work well even for the colleague , for the networks will benefit both of us i would try to make the colleague see how miserable i will be all alone i would act like it is no big deal , and forget about it instead i would try to do a lot better , and have everyone who is important and accessible to notice my efforts in that way , it will be obvious that the manager 's assessment was in correct i would definitely find it enjoyable , it is always fascinating to learn about new cultures , and see how others are different in a good way it is also expanding my territories , who knows \? i might need to travel to norway in my next job
i would try to change mine it is important to keep good relations with coworkers , so i would sacrifice myself , but next time it 's my turni would try to finish it up a couple days before due time , because if i know my boss , he would come up with something at the last minute , so i would be ready beforehandi would go for sure if i do n't know anyone there i can meet new people and make new friends , so i would n't miss the opportunityi would feel angry , but i would try to find some explanation from my boss , why is he giving me that bad score in my job , there should be a reasonvery enjoyable since i love to learn from other cultures , i love to know people from other countries , it enriches your culture and gives you a new point of view in life
i would go ahead and change my vacation plans as i am much more flexible it would not even be a second thought to me i would go ahead and make arrangements to change my vacation plans no problem work is what allows me to have vacation so as a loyal employee i would not have a problem changing my vacation dates i would go ahead and ramp up working on the project there is no reason to unnecessarily worry about the due date when i know that i am doing my best to get the project completed earlier since i know my boss likes to give last minute tasks , i am going to be prepared for such a scenario i would wait for another day , another time and place , and not worry about the meeting there will be other days when such meetings can occur , it 's not the only meeting it 's been a long day and i need to take care of myself too i would know that my manager must be having a hard day my manager knows my level of professionalism and i would be very surprised to receive negative feedback about anything i do at work i would talk with my manager later and see what is going on in his head i would find this experience enjoyable i like seeing diverse and different cultures norway would be one of the countries i am interested in , so this assignment would be right up my alley
i would likely be willing to change mine i'm typically flexible in terms of my vacation plans it was also give me a chance to demonstrate to my supervisor i'm a team player i would make every effort to complete the project at least a couple of days early that way i 'd have a buffer if my boss assigns me other tasks time management is a key to success it is also important to know my boss and adapt to his style i would definitely go ! the primary purpose of going to a networking event is to meet people and build relationships also the opportunity to mingle with a significant client in a social setting is a great opportunity to develop that relationship there are too many pros to attending the networking event to miss it i 'd be a bit disappointed in myself , but i would take the time to think about my manager 's feedback i 'd try to see things from her perspective i 'd also look at how i could do better finally i 'd do my best to improve going forward ultimately , my manager feedback matters and needs to be heeded i would definitely volunteer and find the experience enjoyable i am very interested in other cultures i think scandinavia societies are intriguing and quite different than american society norway is very affluent and has much more of communal perspective than the united states and i 'd like to learn a lot more about
i would be ok to change my plans i would want to make sure that i did not have any important plans for my vacation i would want my coworker to know that i am making a sacrifice for him i would want to make sure that my boss knows that i am willing to comprimise for the company i would work hard to get it done early i would want to be prepared in case my boss gives me any last minute tasks i would want my boss to know that i am doing my best to stay on top of these projects i would go to the meeting i would want my client know that we value their business i would want my boss to know that i am doing this for our clients i would gather all the information that i have that disputes his negative feedback i would present this to him and explain my side of the story i would like to be a part of this i think learning more about noway would be exciting i would be happy to take on this assignment
i would also not volunteer to change my plans i would explain what i already had planned to my colleague if this did not work then i would ask the boss to go by seniority i would get it done as quickly s possible i would not want to leave it until later then be unable to complete it and the last minute project it is not good to procrastinate i would still want to go i do not need to have someone with me that i know as i am sociable this would be too good an opportunity to pass up for such a silly reason i would resquest a meeting with my manager i would ask him to please go over the negatives and give me solid examples if the manager was unable to prove to my satisfaction that the negatives were warranted i would ask to speak to someone higher up and bring in hr i think it would be alot of fun i love to learn about other cultures and also travel if needed it would also show a willingness to take on work and be a team player
i would change my date as long as i did n't already have a vacation planned if i switched my days , i would expect my coworker to cover me for my future vacation i would start the project right away and do a little bit each day or every other day so i could get ahead of the project anticipating my boss may throw something new at me , i want to have at least some part of the project completed and not wait for the last minute if this is one of my largest clients , i would assume i would know them so i would go if this account needed a company representative , someone should go and if my coworker was not going , then i would i would definetely complain and ask why they felt that way i would argue my case and try to explain my side , since this affects my bonus if it did n't affect my bonus , i may just let it slide i would find this experience enjoyable it would be a chance to learn something new i do n't think it is boring to learn about different cultures
i would pick a different vacation week , because the week i get a vacation does not matter to me as long as i get a week off i would be respectful of my colleague not wanting to change their plans , and fulfill my work during his her vacation to the best of my ability i would not want to start any sort of conflict with any colleague i work with i would start my project early , intending to finish it within a week i would do this so that i would have plenty of time to finish any of those last tasks that my boss may give me i would also have more peace of mind getting this project finished early i would still go , because this networking meeting would be extremely important this would also push me out of my comfort zone to meet new people , since i wo n't know anyone there i think this situation would actually be more beneficial than if my colleague went i would feel hurt by this feedback emotionally even though i did n't believe it is true , i would still pretend it is for the sake of my job , and take the lesson from his feedback in order to do better hopefully me doing better at my job would help me to not lose my annual bonus i would find this experience to be extremely enjoyable i feel this way because i enjoy learning new things , and i also enjoy learning about different countries and cultures learning this information would help me do better at my job , which excites me as well
i would probably just relent and take a different week , so i did n't have to rock the boat and disrupt the office harmony that is , unless i had set plans that would be difficult for me to alter \( for instance , if i was planning my vacation around my travel mates' schedule \) if that were the case , i would try to kindly explain my issue with my colleague and ask if there was a way we could compromise by allowing me to do a favor for him her in return if she she does n't budge on the issue , i would discuss the issue with my boss and let he she decide i would work as hard as i could in those two weeks to get as much done as i could if my boss tries to give me last tasks along the way , i would kindly discuss my situation with him her i feel that honestly is always the best policy and i would tell him her that while i am very confident in my ability and i would stress that it is incredibly important that the work i put into the project is quality , but having extra tasks on top of this project could prevent me from completing the project i would explain how important my performance is and just try to be as honest as possible in hopes that he she will try to lighten my load until i completed the project i would try to talk my colleague into going anyway and explain why it is so important that we attend , since it 's one of our largest clients i would hope that i did n't have to explain why , since it would be obvious as to why we should be there , but i would do it anyway if my colleague still does n't want to go , i would try to bribe him or her in a friendly way , by offering a favor in return , whether it be trading time off or taking on an extra project of theirs if he she still wo n't go , i would have to suck it up and reluctantly go alone i think this meeting is much more important than my pride in having to go alone it would really upset me and bother me , especially since i know it is n't true i would analyze the whole situation , because that is what i do when i receive criticism \( including my self criticism \) if i had colleagues that happened to witness my innocence , i would go to them and see if they would vouch for me then i would i would go straight to my boss and ask him her if he she could elaborate on this feedback and tell me why he she feels i deserved such negative remarks after my boss elaborates , i would then plead my case and explain how the situation is not true if i have back up , i would bring in my co workers to be a witness for me to help prove that said situation is not true i would also tell my boss that i hold myself under the law of ethics and always strive to be honest and perform at my best having such negative feedback not only carries real consequences , but it also carries internal consequences for myself after i plead my case , i would allow my boss to decide from there i would find the experience mostly enjoyable , albeit slightly frustrating at times when trying to help the client navigate through parts he or she might find confusing but for the most part , i would enjoy working with someone from norway , since it would be an educational experience it would offer me a chance to learn about another culture and expand my network as we worked together i do n't think it would be boring in the least
i would first consider whether it was easy to change my vacation dates if so , i would change with no issue if it would be difficult or cost me more money , i would implore management to consider who made the first request for pto i would begin the project immediately two weeks of downtime is a lot and i would n't want to be bored at work with a project due soon plus , my boss 's tendency to give me last minute work would encourage me to clear me current workload i would definitely go , regardless of my colleague networking is very important , even more so with your largest client i need to meet these people anyway , and a social event is a much more comfortable first encounter than a work event plus maybe there will be free food or drinks ! i would follow up with my boss regarding the criticism at a later time maybe he was more critical because he was having a bad day also to be considered is whether he may be correct in his assessment if i deserved the criticism , i will take it to heart and try to correct it i would enjoy learning more about norway i did a project on norway as a first grader and have enjoyed the country and her people since then maybe i would get lucky and be able to travel there for work
i would want to know the reason for my colleague 's unwillingness to change plans non refundable tickets \? family coming to town \? some things take precedence over others i would begin the project as soon as possible what if my boss , again , gives me something last minute to do \? the project has a deadline and presumably enough allotted time to finish it i would beg my colleague to attend i am extremely anxious in social situations going to this type of meeting alone would be a nightmare i would not be happy about it i would request a meeting with my manager to discuss my concerns hopefully my manager would gladly provided concrete examples of the reasons for negative feedback if not , i would let it go i would find this experience enjoyable learning about a new culture is always intriguing meeting the client from norway would be interesting i would definitely want to know the client 's feelings about america
i would let them have the days assuming that they buy me lunch for that day if they did this then my plans can still be changed no problem if they do n't buy me lunch well then we will have to play rock paper scissors i would immediately start working i like to get the work i have on back order done as soon as possible because i do n't like to procrastinate if i do it all fast and correctly it helps with my later review i would for sure try and get them to come along to this meeting if they come along we both could receive some much needed contacts in this business i also think that us working together would get people to like our company more because they see how good we work together i would reconnect with the boss and asked them for more details hopefully from this meeting they will reconsider their feedback and reassess if they do n't then i will ask for proof of my downfalls i will also show all the positives that i have done i would find this experience enjoyable anytime i can do stuff with people from other countries i'm complete for it i like to gain perspectives from people outside the usa this is an opportunity that is a must
i would talk to my family first , and see whether our plans could be changed however , i would also talk to my co worker , and see if there is a way that we could compromise if we cannot reach an agreement , then i 'll talk to my family and see how flexible we can be with our plans i would be angry with my co worker , but also realized that sometimes plans have to change i would spend time doing what i can with what details i know about the project i would also make sure to talk to my boss and ensure that there are no last minute details that would make the project longer after i 've made sure of all the facts , i would try to do the project earlier so that in case my boss decides that there has to be some last minute changes , i would not be too affected i would decide to go to the networking meeting anyways and try to stretch myself when it comes to meeting new folks i would be mad with my colleague , but i 'd also get over it i would also try to be friendlier with folks and strike up conversations with them , just so that i could leave the door open in case i ever decided to leave my job in addition , i would make sure that i made a good impression on the people that i was networking with i would go up to the manager and ask how i could improve i would acknowledge that maybe my work habits are not as good as they should be , and ask for suggestions on how to improve i would then start taking steps in order to be more efficient at work i would also try to be more diligent with my work i would find this experience enjoyable because i would be learning a lot about a different culture i would be able to experience a whole bunch of new things and especially new cuisine i would not like the weather , but i could learn to adapt to it in addition , i would do my best to make a good impression on the client there
i would want to find out which one of us has requested this time off first which one of us has more seniority also , i would want to find out how much this person has invested his time in the company if the times are more than my own then i would pick another week to ask off for vacation if the other party has less seniority and less times then i would not want to change my vacation dates i would work on the project as much as possible this way if my boss gives me more tasks later then i will be more prepared for them i wo n't have to work faster on the project and make room for errror i would balance out my time to get it completed sooner before he needs me to do something else i would first try to persuade my colleague the benefits of going if they decide not to go then it will be their loss i will make the best of it i will do everything in my power to make the meeting successful i will continue to talk with the clients on my own i would not feel very good about this situation i would want to get to the root of the problem and see what has happened i would ask to speak with my manager i would not allow someone elses feedback to weigh negatively on my annual bonus if it was not true i would find this very enjoyable i feel like getting to know other clients in other countries can be very beneficial i would want to learn as much as possible i think that i would enjoy getting to know the ins and outs of this project
i would find out how much time and money my colleague has invested so far in her vacation plans if it is a lot i would demand that i get the week , unless she is willing to compensate me for my trouble i would also find out who has been with the company the longest , who had vacation last , etc and use all the stuff that would support my deserving the choice , and of course , none of anything that would show i did n't deserve it i would try and duck this project any boss that changes the task in midstream is not a very good manager and that type of person usually tries to shift the blame of a blown assignment to someone else , but take credit when success is achieved i would be working on my resume if i was in such a situation i would go because i like parties ! since no one there would know who i was , i could get blasted and hit on anyone and anything i like at the meeting the first thing i would do is suggest that we move the meeting to a gentleman 's club , or at a bar with a live band the next time i saw my colleague i 'd tell him it was n't worth going and he lucked out by staying away i would threaten to quit if she did not retract or change the feedback it is a worker 's market and jobs offers are plentiful right now , so the worker is in a very good position to demand as much as she can get if the economy tanks though this answer would be revisited i would volunteer reading and watching videos about other countries is something i do now in my free time , so this would be like getting paid for my entertainment i do n't see how i would not find the experience enjoyable
i would change my vacation time in order to do whats best for the company i also dont want to waste time arguing with an ignorant and selfish person having the respect of my boss is more important than a vacation i would work overtime in order to finish those tasks in the same day its important to stay on top of my work no matter what i like to do my best at all times i would talk to the manager and let him know my colleage is trying to skip the meeting if my colleage does not go the meeting then i will go to the meeting and do my best to represent my employer in the best way i must do what is good for the company i would have a talk with the manager to discuss what went wrong and what should i do to make things better i like to do my best at work at all times i take my work seriously i would find the experience enjoyable i like to learn new things and this would be the perfect opportunity to learn about a new culture learning is fun and educational
if my plans were n't that important i would just be the bigger person , and let them have the week of vacation if it was something that i had planned for a while , though i would talk further with my boss , and try to come to a better conclusion i might offer to work over time on my return from vacation to persuade my boss into letting me have the time off i would work on the the project a little each day , so that if my boss did give me last minute task i would n't be stressed , and overwhelmed i feel it 's important not to procrastinate i also might just work really hard to finish it before the due date so that a last minute task would n't be a problem i would feel much better about having my fellow colleague there , but networking is an important opportunity i think i would still go i could potentially better my myself by networking so it 's something that i would just suck up , tired or not i would feel very angry , and like my voice was n't heard i mean losing an annual bonus is a big deal to me i would try , and talk to the manager again , and try to come to a better conclusion if that did n't work i would talk to higher up management and see if they can help i would love to work on a project that is related to another country , and culture learning about other parts of the world is very fun i believe i think it would be even better if i got to travel there , and experience it in person new foods , ways of living , and rich culture sounds amazing
i would assess what i am using the vacation for and whether or not i had plans i would also assess who had been with the company longer if i did n't have significant plans , i would choose a different vacation week \( but a desirable one \) and insist on it up front if i had plans , i would approach my supervisor and explain the situation so that i would be the one who gets vacation approved that week i would try to get the project completely done up front , if my workload is light i would also try to take care of any personal duties in the meantime so that working extra hours before the deadline is n't an issue that way , if i receive last minute tasks , i can complete them additionally , i will have completed most if not all of the project , so any unforeseen issues i will have already uncovered i would likely go , but only for a short while a large client is important , and i would be cordial but brief unless i unexpectedly found myself having a great time it is important to make the effort and be seen i do not have to stay for very long if i find the meeting unpleasant i would meet with my manager one on one and discuss it if the manager raises good points , i would accept the negative feedback if the manager does not have a good explanation , but would be willing to change the negative feedback , i would welcome it if there is no good explanation and the manager does n't change the feedback , i would explore alternatives these would include look for another manager or unit within the company to transfer to , consider going over the manager 's head \( to his her manager \) , or escalating negative upward feedback on my manager so that they face real consequences also i would find this very enjoyable , provided i do n't have to travel it is a chance to learn something new , meet people from a very different culture , and put something very unique on my resume i also find norway interesting , and would like to learn more about it i have commitments here , however , so i would only welcome this involvement if travel was not required , or if travel was required , no more than once a year , and for no more than 1 week
i would ask who put in their vacation request first whoever put in for the vacation time first should be the one that gets the vacation during that time if they put in for it at the same time , i would suggest that it goes to the person with the most seniority with the company i would create a basic outline of the project that could be finished off very quickly if necessary i would then continue to work on improving and fine tuning it this way you are prepared for both scenarios you can have it ready on time even if more work is presented to you , but if not , you can do the extra work on the project i would try to talk my colleague into going if they decide not to go , i would still go by myself it might be an opportunity to make progress and advance your career sometimes you have to leave your comfort zone to make progress , and if you do this by yourself this time , it will make it easier for you the next time i would feel like i was being treated a little unfairly i would ask for a meeting to discuss this at the meeting i would express my feeling in a polite , and professional manner if they felt their negative feedback was appropriate , i would ask them for advice on how i could improve on this i would find it enjoyable i am interested in traveling and learning more about other cultures even if traveling was n't involved , it would still give me the chance to learn more about another culture , and would most likely give the the chance to interact with people from this culture
i would find out what everyone 's plans are the plans would be my deciding factors and if someone was going to lose money etc i would then have the decision made by an unbiased choice maker i would get this project done as quickly as possible there is always the chance something might need changed and giving yourself a cushion is preferred i would not dilly dally on it i would still attend the networking meeting it is important in continuing your career and it very important you need to put in an effort to get effort i would discuss the feedback with my supervisor i may not believe it is truth but there may be an extenuating circumstance that might change my mind i would then work on it i would absolutely jump at the opportunity to do this i love to learn a lot and in depth about different things learning about another country would be great and help expand my own understanding of my country
i would probably change , assuming that i do not have money already sunk into a planned vacation in that case , assuming that i had already booked , i would stick to my guns or ask for compensation in that scenario i presumably asked first and already spent money in good faith and would expect the company to support me i would approach my boss and let him know that my current work schedule is light i would ask if he is aware of any potential last tasks that i could look into presently this would demonstrate engagement and potentially save me a future headache i would probably not go as well , but it would depend on the circumstances the long day of work would be an adequate excuse in my mind that is assuming that it is optional and not mandatory that i show or it is not necessarily expected of me i would confront my manager and voice my concerns i am not afraid of confrontation , especially when i am in the right the fact that i could potentially suffer consequences if the record is not straightened out just makes me all the more motivated i would find in enjoyable i generally enjoy learning new things , and this situation would qualify it would also increase my value to the company and increase the chance that i would get to travel , which also interests me
i would try and see if i can reschedule my vacation without incurring any penalties i do not like conflict and if i can make adjustments without having to deal with conflict i would i feel that may work best for everyone involved i would try and complete the project before the due date to ensure that i am not rushing at the last minute i will try and prepare myself for any last minute being thrown at me which might need my time and attention i would try and go there for a little to make contacts and see if i can try and do some networking since its been a long day , i might be inclined to leave earlier than the other people at the meeting i would feel really bad about the feedback especially if i believe it is n't true coz it is not reflective of my work and my efforts since it could carry real consequences , it would make me mad i know i work hard and deserve better than that i would try and reason with him and talk to him about why i feel that it is unfair i think i would find the experience enjoyable coz i love to learn about different countries and their culture i feel there is so much to learn from other cultures and it makes us richer as people i would take keen interest in learning all i can to help with the project
i would be the one to change my vacation , because i prefer that it be less busy at work i would put all my attention and focus on this project and hope my boss does n't throw a last minute thing in for me to worry about i would try to convince them to go so that both of us have someone to go with \( each other \) i would contact the higher ups to air my grievances with them , so that maybe they could set my manager straight i would enjoy it , because i am always interested in learning of the culture of different countries , and it just so happens that i find the scandinavian countries interesting
i would ask my supervisor to make a decision based on seniority if she fails to do that , i may consider taking my grievance to human resources i would also ask if both of us could take the same vacation and use a temp service to cover our work i would do the project as planned i would put in extra hours to make sure the project is completed given that my boss gives last minute work , i would be prepared for any new projects coming my way if no new projects came , i would use the extra time to go over the original project i would still go to the networking meeting i would try to convince my colleague to join me but if she does n't , i will still go it is important to make business connections i would ask to speak to my manager again and ask for specific instances that she thinks required negative feedback i would ask for a period of time to improve before i lost my bonus completely i think i would like to learn about a new culture , and things about the country i like learning about other cultures so this is a natural fit for me
i would allow my colleague to take the vacation on condition that he has an agent thing to do more than mine in order to be fairi would put all my efforts in my current project and finish on time as i await for any updates from my bossi would persuade my colleague to go but if unsuccessful i would just go alonei would be in a dilemma of facing my manager r just accept the feedback and improve on my weakness hence i would definitely listen to my manager and change on whatever weaknesses that he has pointed outi would find it both enjoyable and boring in the sense that enjoyable due to the fact that i get to learn new things about the culture and country and boring due to the fact that i only deal with the theoretical part of the cultural background and country instead of experiencing it firsthand
i would want to know why my colleague cannot change his her plans if he she has something booked for that week and i do not have any specific plans , i would be glad to choose another week off if my colleague has no specific plans he she has already made , though , i would think that whoever has seniority should get that week off i would go ahead and start working on the project now that way , i can be finished with it \( or close to finished \) if my boss might give me some other last minute task i can get any and all work done now and make life easier for myself and for my boss i would try to convince my colleague to go with me to the networking meeting if he she refuses , though , i would go to the meeting by myself , even if i did not know anyone else there since this is an important client , it is important for my company to be represented there and my participation could lead to landing a new client i would feel really stressed and largely powerless i would want to speak to my manager in more detail about the feedback since i do not believe it is true it would not be fair for me to be penalized for misplaced negative feedback if i cannot speak further about this with my boss , i would probably turn to one of my most trusted coworkers to grumble and complain about the situation i would enjoy being involved with this project i like learning new things about different countries and culture , especially those connected with western civilization if there was any chance of having to travel , i would not volunteer because i hate flying i have some interest in the music scene in norway right now , though , so i would definitely like to learn more about the people there
i would move my vacation plans only one of us can be gone from work that week if my colleague refuses to change his vacation dates than i will have to i would get this project done as fast as possible my workload is light right now however , it may not stay that way if my boss gives me additional tasks i would encourage my colleague to attend the meeting it 's a good networking opportunity i would also know at least one person in attendance i would feel very sad about the situation i would set up another meeting with the manager to discuss his feedback i would find this experience enjoyable i would enjoy learning more about norway its culture
i would argue that i put in for the vacation time first before my colleague did and this should be on a first come first serve basis and i would even remind my supervisor that i am more senior than heri would try to get the project done ahead of time since my work load is light leading up to the due date so that if there is any last minute tast given by my boss it they can be handled effectivelyi would welcome the challenge i go to the conference anyway and make my presence know by making contacts at the conference that will be helpful going forward with the clienti would feel bad about the situation and take a look at at the feedback the boss gave and if it is something i can learn from then although i would be upset in not getting the bonus i know going forward i can learn from it i would find this experience really really enjoyable and would welcome it with open hand to learn about our new client and country so if other projects of this sort comes up i am positioned to take it immediately
i would try to come up with a compromise depending on the situation , i would discuss options with my colleague maybe we can work out a deal where i take vacation at a different time in exchange for a favor or we could possibly split the days available for us to take vacations i would create smaller milestones in order to pace myself so i do n't get overwhelmed at the last minute i would schedule out my time so that i make good progress every day or so and ensure that this project gets done on time , regardless of any additional tasks i'm assigned i would try to convince my colleague to come i might offer to drive him or buy him dinner or something like that if he insists on not going , i would still go by myself and try to network as best as i can i would discuss the feedback with my manager and see if i can find out where he 's coming from he 's pretty open to conversations like that , so i'm sure we could come up with a compromise if not , i would reach out to his manager to see if there 's anything else that can be done i would find this experience enjoyable i do n't know anything about norway and it would be interesting to learn it would also be beneficial to be one of the only people in the country with some knowledge of norway 's customs and culture
i would probably just work the schedule as normal i would definitely use this though for my next pay raise and make sure my boss knows that i gave up my vacation time to accommodate a co worker i would not be angry towards my co worker , even though inside i would feel anger towards him her i would start working on the project immediately i would start doing a little bit on the project each day so that in the event my boss did give me last minute work to do on top of the project , i would be able to get everything done on time being organized and having time management is very important to me i do n't think i would go either i am very uncomfortable in situations where i do n't know anyone it 's just a networking meeting , not something critical , so i think i could miss it without any serious repercussions i would be angry and upset i would possibly try going over my manager 's head to see if i could have this feedback reviewed it could possibly affect my salary and position with the company so it is in my best interest to fight the negative feedback as much as i can i would find this experience very enjoyable ! i am always interested in learning about new cultures , especially nordic countries i would hope that i could maybe get to travel there at some point , but if not , just learning about it would be great !
i would change when i took vacation time if i had already made plans or booked tickets somewhere , i would request some sort of compensation for any expenses that arose from having to change my plans another idea is to see who asked for the vacation time first and let the person who asked first keep their plans i would take advantage of my light workload to get a good head start on the project and complete as much of it well ahead of time as possible this would help avoid complications from any last minute tasks my boss might give me this would reduce stress and help ensure that i did my best work i would encourage that colleague to go to the meeting with me so i would have their support if they were unwilling to go i might also skip the meeting , if possible i would explain that we had both just had a difficult workday i would confront the manager about my feelings about the feedback and ask why i recieved it because i believe it to be untrue , and explain that it could have consequences for me if they were unwilling to see things my way , i would talk to the manager 's boss about this situation and again explain my point of view i would feel rather upset and like i was being singled out or punished for some reason other than my work performance i would find this experience enjoyable , as i generally like to learn about other places and cultures i would be more interested if travel was involved as i also would like to travel abroad more learning about and experiencing other cultures are things i do in my free time , so doing them as a part of work would be an added benefit
i would then approach the supervisor and ask that they make a decision based on seniority it is the next fairest way to solve the problem whoever has been with the company longest gets their choice of vacation week they have earned it i would steadily continue the work on my project during the lull in my workload in order to get ahead of any distractions that may arise this way when the boss does decide to give a last minute task , i will have the available time to dedicate to it and not fall behind on my own project i would still attend the networking meeting without my colleague this meeting is with one of our largest clients missing it could also mean missed business or career opportunities i would grab a cup of coffee and pull up a seat i would ask my manager to please explain what i was not doing correctly , and to help educate me as to how they would like the work done i need specifics or i ca n't correct what i did n't know i was doing poorly i would find this experience enjoyable learning about a different culture can be an amazing experience it is also an added bonus to building a resume to volunteer on any type of project
i would consider the situation as one that i can show maturity and depth i would tell my boss that i will change my vacation week to a different week i would explain to the boss that i recognize that responsibility is a big part of any job and to show my responsibility to the job i have i would be willing to change the vacation dates i was going to take i would break this project into small manageable parts being my current work load is light i know i am able to get the project done over the next two weeks , very easily because i know my boss often throws in last minute tasks i am sure to get this project done before the last minute due to the fact that this invitation is from a large client i will accept the invitation if my coworker decides to go or not i want to show this client respect i may not know anyone before i go but i will meet new people during this meeting i would want to correct what ever i was doing that caused the negative feedback i would explain to my manager how i felt but that i want to understand what am doing wrong this way i can learn and correct what the problems ar ei would love to learn new things about another culture and location , even though i was not going to travel there i would find this a learning experience that is positive it would be great !
i would ask my supervisor who has seniority in this commpany if i have more years than my colleague i will take my vacation days as scheduled if my colleague is my senior , i will simply use my vacation day in another week i would ask my boss beforehand if there 's anything i need know before starting if there is something i will complete it before officially starting afterwards i will continue with the project as soon as possible if nothing occurs , i believe i have enough time to finish i would go without my colleague because i can have a face to face meeting with my client there would be several topics i can discuss with the if all goes well maybe i can get promoted or pitch an idea i would agree with the feedback and just continue doing my job i do not feel it 's worth fighting for if i'm going to loose my bonus if my manager insist i'm doing a bad job or remove my annual bonus , i will simply find a new job i would not find this experience enjoyable unless i am paid to travel doing research for a country you will never go to is boring in my opinion i will let someone else take the job while i plan my own vacation to norway if another colleague is not up to the task , i can at least tell my bosses i 've been to norway and learn a lot from my stay
i would do my best to talk to my family members and try to change our plans i would also see if there is a compromise that could be made perhaps my coworker could the beginning of that week and i could take the end of that week i would work really hard on it right away i would spend all of my free time working on this project i would make sure it was done quickly but very well done so i would be available for any other projects i would probably still go the point of a networking meeting seems to be to network even if my coworker did go i would want to mingle and meet new people i would sit down with the manager i would ask why they feel this way and if they can provide me some real examples of when they felt this was an issue i would do everything in my power to show them they are mistaken , and if they are right i would accept the consequences i would find this enjoyable i love learning about new countries and cultures i think it is really important to know about the cultures and expectations of clients , so it makes sense to have someone learn about the country like this
i would state the reasoning why i had requested the vacation to be that week and ask her to state her reasoning if her reasoning was better , then i would tell her she could have that week and i will take another if she was being difficult and could not come up with good reasoning , then i would take it to my supervisor again i would start the project the day it was given to me if i get a little bit done each day , then i will be prepared if my boss throws a last minute project on me i am a very well prepared person so i would like that to be shown to my boss as well i would suggest my coworker to go with me because it could open a lot of doors and be a good time if she is not wanting to go , i will keep an open mind i could potentially earn new clients or learn new ways to help my current job i would bring it to the ceo 's attention that i feel i was not advised correctly if i feel i got wrong punishment , i do not want to take the fall for something that could possibly either get me terminated or make me lose money i always want to be fair and i want to be treated fairly as well i would find this experience extremely enjoyable i love learning about new places and ways of doing certain things i can not travel very much due to obligations but research and talking with someone , would be very interesting
i would consider my vacation plans and see if it is crucial that i take time off work to attend to my plans if my plans are changeable or could be done at a later date , then i will oblige and let my colleague take the time off if i cannot change my plans , then i would ask my supervisor to consider which colleague they think deserves to take the time off more after we both send in a written explanation on why we need the time off for that particular week i would progress on this project as much as possible , with the expectation that there will be heavier work load at the last minute i would also ask my boss to try to prepare as best as they can and inform me early if there will be any strenuous , last minute tasks i would also make sure that i set aside a good amount of time near the due date of the project just in case i would have to prepare for any big last minute tasks i would ask why my colleague is more inclined to skipping the networking meeting and if there are no reasonable answers , then i would try to convince them to go i would explain that networking events are important opportunities to advance their career or to meet the right people that could set my colleague on different paths if my colleague still does n't want to go , then i would probably go to the networking meeting by myself unless there is another colleague i can ask to come with i would feel anxious or worried about this situation and also possibly angry if some of the feedback was unnecessary if any of the feedback is factual or something that i agree could be improved upon by me , then i would acknowledge to my manager that i have areas of improvement and discuss my plans on how to improve if there is feedback that i believe to be of the wrong opinion , then i would talk with my manager and provide them with evidence that supports my opinions on the matter if travel is not involved , then i would probably find this experience to be more boring if the potential for travel is involved , then i would consider volunteering , but would still find the experience of learning to be more of a chore than enjoyable i feel this way because learning information about the country of norway is not something that i would be particularly interested in investing my time into except if there was a good return on my investment
i would try to figure out if either of us had plans for that week scheduled if there are any nonrefundable deposits already paid , or if it is just unfeasible to reschedule taking that info i would decide whether i was going allow them to take the vacation time or take the issue to management i would plan on finishing my project before the due date i would also take time to really keep in contact with my manager , so that any additional tasks are given to me as soon as possible that way i would have a little leeway to do any additional tasks i would try to convince my coworker to change their mind if that did n't work , i would go to the network meeting myself while i would feel less confident not knowing anyone there , the potential benefits of going out way any negatives i would talk with my manager about how i feel about the evaluation if that did n't work i would go to higher management if neither of those worked , i would look for other employment i would find the experience exciting i love learning about other cultures and love studying different languages even if not required to travel , i would probably use it as an opportunity to
i would change my plans and go on vacation at a different time vacation time for me is flexible so i can work with others schedules to me work comes before pleasure so making sure my company 's needs were met before mine were would be the most important thing knowing my boss can throw in extra work , i would get as much done on the project as i could in a timely manner should my boss throw in extra tasks i would then have time to tackle those things as well as the ongoing project i would adjust time and task accordingly to complete all that i had to do ii would look at this as an opportunity to get to know more people and learn more about this client i would meet with this client to make sure that they know that we really care about having them as a client and that they will be taken care of in the future for all their business needs i would first try and figure out what i could do to make up for the bad review i would then ask to take on extra work to make up for what i had done in a manner they didnt approve of i would go out of my way to correct the situation and do extra to make sure that they know i can perform up to their expectationsi would definitely find this project very enjoyable i would love to research and find out about norway and the culture of all who live there i would try and find pertinent information about norway and how to tie that into our business i would try and find out how similar and different both our country and theirs are
i would ask the supervisor if he thought it was fair that my colleague should be able to take the vacation week when i had already requested it i would then state that it was not fair to do that when i had already put in for that week if my supervisor did not respond accurately and made us decide between us , then i would make sure that i was the better performing employee and then i would proceed to go to human resources i would start the project immediately te hen , knowing what i need to do if i know that my boss tends to hand me last minute tasks , i would be wise to get the project done and have spare time to work on others that might come up that is what a hardworking , smart employee would do i would go ahead and go it does n't matter that my colleague does n't go , i only need to worry about my own leadership and work ethics we do n't always have to have someone help us a great leader does things on his her own terms i would request a meeting with the supervisor and human resources a mediator is needed for this type of situation i would remain calm and just discuss it with them and let hr make the final decision never take a meeting alone with the individual you think is in the wrong i would jump at the chance any time you have an opportunity to shine , then you need to take it bosses love to see their employees take initiative employees that always stay in the background usually never advance
i would discuss it with my supervisor further i would ask who requested it first then i would ask who had more seniority in the company i do n't think it 's fair that i would have to change mine just because the other person does n't want to i would start working on the project right away i would feel more secure getting it done early rather than wait until the last minute especially knowing that the boss often gave out last minute tasks i would go to the meeting with the client it is too important not to attend it it would n't matter if i knew anyone there i would first discuss the feedback with them if they would n't change it or tell me why , i would go to their supervisor about it i would tell them the situation and complete a statement about it to be put in my personnel file i would be quite mad about the situation i would find this enjoyable i have an interest in other cultures and countries i would like to learn more about norway
i would contemplate how important it really is to take my vacation that week if possible , i would change my plans for either the week before or week after when i originally planned to vacation if my plans were set in stone , i would ask my supervisor if we could have a sit down and i would explain that my plans cannot be changed and how important they are to me i would use my free time in the mean time to work on my project i may also see if it s possible to complete my project at home either in the evenings or on the weekend i would do this because i like to have my work completed ahead of time , for situations where my boss throws extra work my way i don t like to be ill prepared i would go i have no problem socializing with people i don t know it could be very beneficial for me to network , and it would look good to my client to show up i would be upset , but address the situation diplomatically i would ask my manager if we could discuss why they felt the way they did , give my feedback on it , and see if there was a way we could compromise or maybe change my manager s mind i would find it to be enjoyable and see the chance for growth , both professionally and personally it would give me the opportunity to expand my resum and work experience within the company i find learning about different cultures and new languages to be intriguing
i would first assess the situation objectively i would consider my plans for the vacation and determine if i could carry out those plans at a different time if it would work for my spouse and family , i would definitely agree to let my colleague have that time slot for their vacation otherwise , i would ask my superior to determine in a fair way , say by time on job or other method to determine fairness if a mutual agreement could not be reached , i 'd have to consider how important the job is to me because sometimes you just have to make a choice between fairness and necessity i would try to get the project close to being finished as soon as i could knowing i could be given more assignments unexpectedly , i would n't want to take a chance on getting behind it would make me feel much less stressed knowing the project was already complete and ready to turn in ahead of time i would go alone if i want to have an opportunity to expand my client base , it 's makes more sense to just go alone while it might be uncomfortable arriving alone , i know from past experience there will be others who are flying solo it would give me more of an opportunity to freely mingle and get to know more people if i do n't have a crutch to distract me \( my colleague \) i would feel horrible especially knowing something negative could come about because of the negative feedback i think i would ask my manager for a meeting to discuss the situation i would hope to plead my case and if the negative feedback is legit , i would ask for the opportunity to correct the situation and then be reevaluated i would look at this experience as an opportunity to learn something new i think it would be enjoyable to spend some work time learning about another country it would probably be enjoyable because it would be something out of the norm and i like to learn about different cultures anyway
i would compare my plans with my colleague first and see whether them or i have something important to attend , like a wedding or something involving children if they are still unwilling to budge , i would then consult my family about what to do regarding the issue i would make it a point to say that my colleague is unwilling to change their vacation plans and my supervisor is putting pressure on me i would make sure my project is dealt with and completed earlier than the due date if i have the knowledge that my boss sometimes gives me last minute tasks , using that to finish my project early will mean i will not be scrambling last minute if they do if they do n't , then no harm no foul i would still go while it would make me nervous to go by myself , if i am invited to a network meeting with one of my largest clients , it is imperative that i attend it is important to make a good impression to continue having a strong working relationship with your client i would ask my manager if they could give me specific examples on where to improve and what to do better while i may not agree or believe that it is true , i know the power they have over my job sometimes you just need to grin and bear it in these kinds of circumstances i would be indifferent about this experience i think norway would be an interesting place to visit , but since it is n't necessary to travel , and the information learned is purely for a better business relationship , it might be a little boring however , having more knowledge about your clients will ultimately benefit you and the company which could lead to work based rewards
well i'm not willing to change my plans either i wanted this vacation and if it 's for a week that means i probably made reservations to leave the country also , based off of the passage , it appears that i could have requested it first either way , i'm simply not going to show up during that week , so what happens happens i 'd work on the project piece by piece day by day so it 's never overwhelming , and at a pace where i'm sure to finish a few days before the due date with that in mind , it would make any last minute tasks more manageable with that being said , if the tasks are too unreasonable and time consuming then my boss can go kick rocks with all this last minute shenanigans i would probably still go it seems like i could benefit from this whether my colleague is there or not , so them not going does n't really sway me it 's not like i would know anymore of the people there if they did n't go sure i would know my colleague but let 's say there 's fifty other people and my colleague makes fifty one , that 's still fifty people i do n't know vs the one i do i would go if i do n't agree with the feedback then i am going to say something about it if i feel i am being cheated i am not going to do or say nothing i would n't be upset or angry just in a state of mind where i want to resolve this if nothing changes as a result , then so be it , but at least i will have tried and i 'd probably looking for a new job as well i think i would find it enjoyable i 'd actually be excited to go as i like traveling and exploring new places the fact that i need to learn some things is n't a deterrent at all , but a welcome experience i do n't see why i would back out other than fear related reasons
being a fair person i would ask for another time slot for my vacation this will help the company and perhaps i will get a bonus or raise for my willingness to be flexible i would make sure my assignment was done well in advance and that frees me up to tackle other projects which the boss might assign in so doing it will show my prompt attention to detail and in meeting the deadline i would look at this opportunity to make my network availability known without my colleague it will give me a chance to explore my options in the networking area and perhaps get a better paying job offer i would go alone and not insist on my colleague going with me i would read the negative feedback and analyze it after all we all have flaws and perhaps this is a chance to use this time to enhance my skills when being critiqued in the work place we must realize it can be a very big part of your job performance if this did not include my performance i am not worried but welcome the challenge to better myself and be a better employee very enjoyable in learning the customs their ideals ethics and moral stands the work performance in this project means a big bonus and will offer the company a huge benefit to work with other countries i will gladly accept the challenge and learn all i can to fulfill my duties as a great employee
i would allow my colleague to the week 's vacation however , since i am giving in and allowing them to have the week , i would request an extra few days of vacation to be used at another time i would point out that i am being flexible and try to use that to my advantage although the project is due in two weeks , i would try and complete the project quickly i would use the free time i have to knock out the important part of the project knowing that my boss will probably give me more work to do at the last minute i would not want to be pressured to do it all at one time since it has been a long day i would probably lean toward not going the fact my colleague probably wo n't go either , it would make it less likely for me to attend the meeting i would make up an excuse of some prior engagement i have to go to i would be very frustrated about the negative feedback i would set up a meeting to discuss what led him her to give me such a rating i would bring documentation of all the work i had completed to back up point of view i would enjoy learning about a new country i would like meeting new people from other places i would find the work a new area i could explore and relieve some of the boredom from the everyday workload
i would see whether or not i could move my plans it would be dependent on what i already had planned if it is something i could not move i would try and negotiate with my colleague because it is n't fair to cancel something you already have reservations for i would start with an outline of what i wanted to do for the project i would break it up into parts to start right away in case i am given last minute things to work on i would do all the hard parts that require the most time in the beginning and save the easy stuff for last i would prioritize what needs to be done i would go anyway because this is a big client i could meet more people there and it would be to my advantage to go i could meet more people professional that might be able to help me in the future i would just take it and go along with it it would only hurt me further if i were to question my manager i would strive to work on the areas that the manager suggested i would try and get on their good side i would find it enjoyable because i'm learning something new i would be able to put myself in a better position for the company and the client i would become an asset and it could help me in future endeavors
i would be ok with it if i did n't have plans if i had made plans i would speak to my supervisor i would explain that i had the time scheduled first i would work on the project right away it would be better to have it done early i hate having things hang over me i would make up an excuse to get out of it i'm not comfortable if i do n't know anyone not a good decision i know , but it 's what i would do i wouy be very upset the fact that it may affect my bonus is especially upsetting i would go to hr or my bosses boss i would find it boring traveling would be cool , but not this i would still be willing to do it though
i would try to convince them that the person with more seniority should get the week i would take any available time to at least partially finish the project , so if something comes up , i am ahead of the curve already i would deal with it and make an appearance if it is a client , then it is the right thing to go to represent the company i work for i would ask for a meeting to go over the negative feedback in more detail hopefully i would be able to explain why it is not true and validate myself i would find this experience enjoyable it is not everyday you get to go to norway
i would try to make plans for another week i would avoid confrontation i would try to work out the problem to see if we can make it work i would try to finish up early i would try to work on the amount of work before i get more i would concentrate on completing the first task sooner rather then later i would go to learn more it would be a good opportunity to meet new people i would like to find out more information i would talk to my boss i would try to correct what they feel is wrong i would try harder so i don t lose my bonus i would find it fun it is neat to discovery things about another country it would be a good thing to meet this person
i would not put up a fuss about it if the coworker had plane tickets or something and could n't change plans and i had no set plans , i would be ok i would also like to know who made the vacation request first i would work steadily at the task i would not worry about what else might get sent my way later i would not wait until the last minute to complete the job i would do it this way so my work would be complete on time and so i could take on any other tasks presented to me i would go ! i would be excited about going networking could advance my career networking could bring our company more work i would take a few deep breaths listen to what was being said and reply to the situation explaining what they were hearing is not true i would find it enjoyable ! i love learning about other countries and culture i would also hope that bettering myself would lead to other job opportunities
i would do my best to reason with my colleague and see who 's vacation can actually be changed or rearranged and then we would have to reason as adults we would have to work it out or neither person is going to go i would go over it and let my boss know that what he has given me would take a little extra time and that i would do my best to get the work done in a solid amount of time to the best of my ability i would ask if they want to go together , i 'd even throw in some dinner and the fact that i will drive because i do n't want to go alone i do n't want to go and be uncomfortable i would wait until i can go and speak with him individually and let him know that i hear what hes saying however i do n't agree with what he said and these are the reasons why i would be excited to not only travel but learn all kinds of facts about a different country i love learning about new things so this would be a very enjoyable experience
i would let my collegue have the time if they were a close personal friend , and maybe just a colleague if it was really a terrible loss for me to not take that time , if i lost money , or it would hurt my family , i might stand my ground , but people remember these slights , i would not forget that they would not give in i would try to get the work done ahead of time i would want to be prepared for the last minute tasks i would look over the project see what it required sketch it out first do the items i knew would take more time first , then the items i knew i can do quickly i could hold back on a little i would leave the overall put togeather until the end and balance it with the last minute tasks i would go , if it is the largest client it seems pretty mandatory to go to this the client , your boss will all remember this , if you do not go your colleague , has their own issues , if you do n't want to advance then do n't go , if you want to move up then go but it is also bad manners to snub your best client manners do matter i would ask what were the exact issues that are involved i would try to counteract what i feel was inncorrect , take the advice , ask how i can do better and show it in my behavior , and attitude i would love to do this project learning about other cultures and getting involved with the culture is very interesting to me i am a history degree and i love learning all the aspects of a culture , art , history , food , economy and how they feel about the world it would not be work for me to get involved with this project
i would agree to go into work during the week my coworker is absent we would have a conversation about me taking off another time in the future all parties involved would be considerate of each other i would try to see if we could find another coworker to help with my workload i would try and multitask all of the projects under my belt i may see if i could decline this project , and explain that my plate is already full we would have a discussion about the importance of showing for the sake of professionalism i would tell my coworker about the potential negatives of not showing up it 's also prudent for us to show respect to our current client who invited us i would ask them exactly what i did to prompt this negative feedback i would also be curious about real examples that are relevant seeking this kind of feedback is necessary for my own career trajectory i would be excited to learn about this person 's background me learning about norway would show how considerate and respectful to them the client would be more apt to forming long term business relationship by my interest in norway
if they were n't willing to change their time off then i would change mine i would n't be happy about it and i would remember it for the future , but i would do so , since someone has to be at work to keep things from getting crazy i would work on it as much as i could whenever i had time to that way , there was n't as much of a chance of getting a huge , complex problem dumped on me at the last minute and ruining my ability to actually finish the project i would go anyway without them it would be awkward , but it 's an important client and it might give me a opportunity to learn more about the client as well as get in better with them i would be pretty upset about it i would go to my boss and try to calmly ask for more information about why they felt the way they did and see if i ca n't correct the issue before it becomes a problem later on i think it might be fairly enjoyable i like learning about other cultures and i do n't know a whole lot about norway , so it would give me an excuse to learn more about the country and it 's culture
i would think about what i have planned for that week and ask what their vacation plans are i would then determine who requested vacation first if i had plans that it would cost me to change i would speak to my supervisor about this if i did n't have any real plans i would cancel my vacation request if i do n't get a fair resolution i will go to hri would work on the project during my available time i would want to make sure that i'm well planned for what my deadlines are and my boss' prior behavior to prepare myself i always work to complete projects ahead of time so i can be ready to start another one i would go to the meeting i would feel out of place but it is not the first time this type of situation had occurred and i know that i will be comfortable there i would use the time there to get to know their employees so that i would be able to put a face and a name together and establish a working relationship for the future i would feel very upset if i do n't believe the feedback information is true i would ask them to provide me with the documentation to confirm it i would then discuss it further with my manager , and determining on the outcome and the facts behind the feedback i would make a determination of my next steps to take in seeking further assistance if it is constituted i would find this experience very enjoyable i would be able to learn about a place i'm not very familiar with i would be able to interact with people from there and learn about their culture and what life is like there it would also increase my contacts and opportunity for growth within the company
i would evaluate my vacation plans to see if they could be changed first i like to be accommodating , so if i could make a different week work , then i would do so if not , i would ask my colleague to compromise with me so that maybe the next time this situation happens , i would get to go on vacation , and they would stay at work i would start work on the project right away it is good practice to start work as soon as possible in case i encounter any difficulties , or something happens outside of my control that delays me in this scenario , it seems likely that my boss would assign additional , urgent work prior to the project due date , so i would like to build a buffer for myself to accommodate that should the need arise i would attend the networking meeting anyways because the whole purpose of networking is to meet new people and forge new relationships i would have extra incentive to go because the meeting is with one of our largest clients though my mba studies , i have learned the value networking can bring , not just from a business perspective , but from a personal level as well i would go back to my desk and evaluate the feedback given on a deeper level i would then go through any documentation i had that showed why i disagreed with the feedback given , because it 's possible that my boss missed something it is worth it to defend my position , especially if i stand to suffer some real consequences for it this would also show my boss that i care deeply about my work i would find this experience enjoyable because it would challenge me to grow my knowledge base additionally , if there ever was a time i was required to travel , i would be prepared when i arrived in norway i also would enjoy this simply for getting to know a new culture and possibly being able to incorporate some of their customs into my daily life if i found them interesting
it would really depend on my colleague 's situation like if they have children and that is the only time they can take a vacation because of school , etc in this situation i guess i would take a different week , but if it happened again in the future i would hope my colleague would change their plans instead i would start working on the project right away i usually like to start working on things even if the deadline is distant that gives me time to make adjustments if necessary i would go i think it 's easier to network when you are n't with someone you know that forces you to get out there and actually meet new people i would ask to schedule a meeting to talk about the situation i would then try to clarify what happened and give my point of view if my boss is fair then they will try to weigh their decision by my viewpoint too i would find this experience enjoyable because it is interesting to learn about new cultures and clients i like to interact with new people so hopefully i would learn something new even if i did n't find the experience enjoyable i could be proud that i tried it out and did something different
i would offer to pay my colleague if they could change their week if not i would rearrange plans with my family i would tell my boss we need to do things differently next year i would try to talk to my colleague in advance about the next vacation i would try to get this task done as quickly as possible my boss might give me some surprise tasks later , so i need to make sure i have room for them i would want to get this done i would go anyway , because i might find a serendipitous career lead you never know what opportunity awaits i would at least try to network a bit despite being tired i would feel dejected i would talk to my manager about the feedback i would present my argument i might change jobs i would find the experience enjoyable because i like learning about different cultures i would be willing to look into the nitty gritty because my job is providing me with opportunity i can learn about a culture and get paid for it
what i would do depends on a number of factors for instance , who requested vacation first \? how long ago were the vacations scheduled who is really responsible for them being scheduled at the same time however , if the colleague began the conversation by saying that he is not willing to change then i would also refuse to change i would do this because there is no reason to be reasonable when the other party is being unreasonable and the real problem is that someone allowed the vacations to be scheduled at the same time in the first place i would finish the project i have a due date and the time to do it unless there is some reason why i do n't want to finish too early then it would be better to complete it and thus avoid any obstacles that might prevent me from doing so in the future if my boss gave me a last minute task that caused an unnecessary rush i would do my best to complete it but also file a complaint about it regardless of whether i had finished my project or not i would try to convince my colleague to go with me , maybe by trying to persuade him \( or her \) how this will make things easier in the future if my colleague declined i would probably still go i do n't normally believe in using free time for work but i am willing to do so if it helps me \( me in particularly , not necessarily my workplace \) but if the meeting was more than an hour i would also decline i would find out the formal process of disputing the feedback and do so i would see this as someone getting in the way of my livelihood for personal reasons and do everything i can do eliminate the problem i would go through the formal process rather than talking to the manager directly because the latter action could be spun in many ways and could result in an argument that only makes things worse the only thing i would feel is irritation this is not a binary choice it does n't have to be either enjoyable or boring i do n't think i would find this interesting which is n't the same as saying i would find it boring working with people far away means working with an obstacle i do n't want obstacles i want my work to be smooth and easy so i would probably not volunteer and if the situation changed and traveling was required i would definitely not volunteer
if this is the first time this situation has come up with this same colleague , i would agree to take a different week off if this is a recurring pattern , i would try to plan better so that we do n't request vacation for the same weekfirst i would make sure i have completed the necessary tasks for the project due in two weeks then i would approach my boss and ask him if there is anything else he wants me to tackle try to stay one step ahead i would first remind of what a big networking opportunity this is and persuade him her to go if my colleague still does not want to go , i would still go , because you can never network enough , especially when it comes to business i would respectfully try to get to the root of why my manager feels that way even though i may not agree with it , there might be a perspective i am missing and talking to my manager may let me understand it better it is important to understand the real reason of the negative feedback , so i do n't let the same situation come up again i would absolutely love this experience it is always exciting , not to mention a great opportunity to grow when you learn about other cultures and again , you never know what lies in the future , the stuff that i get to learn from this deal may lead to other things
assuming i ca n't change my plans either , i would probably talk to the supervisor about things i do n't think it 's fair that the coworker should be able to essentially bully me into trying to not take my vacation week however , if i can easily change my plans , i probably would n't push it because i would rather not deal with the conflict i would do as much as i could to work on the project while my workload is light that way , if i finish early , great ! but if the boss gives me tasks here and there , i can fit them in if i somehow do n't finish on time , i would just tell my boss that i did my best , but i could n't get it done on time with the additional workload i would go anyway it would make me look good for being there when other colleagues are not , and it could pay off in the future also , part of the point of networking is to step out of your comfort zone and meet new people i would accept the feedback , but also try to ask how to improve if the manager 's suggestions are things i'm already doing \( which they probably are , if i do n't believe it 's true \) , then i can point that out without seeming like too much of a kiss up i would feel bummed , but the possible consequences would motivate me to handle the situation as professionally as possible i would find this experience really enjoyable ! i love learning about other cultures and ways of life , and do so in my free time so getting paid to work with it would be awesome , and probably a nice change of pace
i would offer to change my plans i am a pretty easy going person and if my co worker is unwilling to compromise then i will i like to please others and keep things less tense in the workplace i would start working on it right away i hate to put things off until tomorrow that i can do today i would also want to keep my schedule free just in case any other projects come up i would go anyways , even if my co worker did not i would figure it a great time to socialize and meet new people plus it would probably be beneficial to me and help me learn something new i would feel very upset and worried i would ask my boss right away how i could fix my performance and make things right i would do everything i would to ensure my future at the company as well as make up for any mistakes i made i would find the experience enjoyable i love teaching and helping so i would be perfect to help the client i also love socializing and learning about new cultures any opportunity i have to try something different is great for me
i would take a different week of vacation however , i would only do that if i did not have outstanding obligations on that vacation week if i did , i would negotiate with my colleague i would work a little on the project each day this would ensure that i had it done far ahead of time this way , i could be ready if my boss assigned any last minute tasks i would push myself to go because someone needs to be there the meeting is with one of our largest clients i would not want to jeopardize that relationship and risk losing them i would be very upset however , since i do not want to lose my bonus or end up in a similar situation , i would act like the feedback was correct , even though i believed otherwise i would try to make amends with the manager and act like i learned from the feedback and was attempting to correct whatever was wrong , in an attempt to preserve my bonus i would find the experience enjoyable this is because i enjoy learning new things i also enjoy meeting new people i enjoy enriching and bettering myself , and think i would grow from the experience
i would try to be reasonable and flexible and find out what we are both doing and see if there is any flexibility in either of our plans if i'm able , i would be willing to change my plans to accommodate someone else because that is part of being a team player i would hope down the road someone would do the same for me i would get working on it right away since my workload is currently light that way if my boss decides to throw any last minute tasks my way , i'm not stressing and can handle it i will then be able to get my project done by the due date i would go because it would most likely not look good for me if i did n't go if this was one of my largest clients , i would make an appearance even if i did n't know anyone , i would circle the room , meet a few people , so i at least made an appearance and then leave i would ask them the reasoning for the feedback and see if they could back it up with any factual information if i felt the manager was trying to negatively impact me in an unfair manner , then , i would seek advice from other management if worse came to worse and i needed to stand up for myself , i would contact human resources i would definitely find the experience enjoyable i would love to learn about the norwegian culture , and if i ever got to travel that would be an added benefit i think i would also gain additional experience that could be valuable
i would take one for the team and agree to change my plans i do n't really care that much about vacations anyway , so changing the time would n't be a huge burden on me i 'd rather make the sacrifice to ensure that i do n't lose the favor of my colleague i feel that will make work less unpleasant for me going forward i would probably start right away , just to see how challenging the task is and how much time i 'll need to invest if it ends up being something that will take significant time to complete , i will then have ample time to handle it , and if it 's something that seems fairly straightforward and simple , i will be able to push it off a little bit and take care of it later on before it 's due since i have a light workload , either way will be fine , but i 'd prefer to get started right away to get it out of the way i would avoid going , since i dislike social situations like this even though it would be beneficial to me career wise , i would be reluctant to go to such a networking event without someone else to act as a buffer i would feel bad about it and would feel that i'm doing a disservice to my career , but i would n't go unless i was basically forced to do so i would feel very negatively about this , and i would also feel fairly resentful of my manager i would more than likely not do anything in response to this , other than just possibly daydream about changing jobs and working somewhere else , but i would n't actually do that since i lack the confidence to do so i would probably eventually get over it and just continue working at my present ability level , since i do n't feel i need to change my behavior i would find this experience interesting , especially if it does n't involve actually traveling , since learning about new things is intriguing to me i would feel that i'm learning something about the world that might also make my work with this new client go more smoothly , so it would be beneficial in that regard as well i would thus be glad to volunteer for this activity and would do my best to perform well at it
well depending on my vacation plans i would more than likely change my vacation to another week if i had something planned for my vacation i would try to persuade my colleague to change their dates if i put my vacation request in first i would want to take my vacation first i would try my hardest to get ahead if i could because i know the boss can give me last minute tasks if last minute tasks were too much i would ask the boss for more time or ask if i could put them aside until the project was finished if the tasks are part of the project i would let the boss know i need more time or more people need to work on the project to get it done on time if my colleague does n't want to go to the function i would not want to go either unless it was mandatory i would not go if it was mandatory i would go and try to make the best of it i would tell the manager that i did n't agree with the feedback i would want them to explain why i got the negative feedback i did i would ask if there was anything i could do to fix the issues the manager had with my work so i would n't lose my bonus i would find this interesting but i would be even more interseting if i got to travel to norway too i would want to learn something new about a country and culture i would like to be paid to work on a project like this
i personally would switch with my colleague as i never usually go on expensive trips , etc almost always , it would be something local if i were in this situation and therefore i could switch without too much hassle since i had a very light workload , i would start working on that project that was due in two weeks i would do this because it states my boss gives me last minute tasks i would not take the chance and would start working on it this is probably not good , but i would likely not go i have found that networking events do n't really do much for business so i would probably opt out myself on this one possibly losing a bonus and other consequences is not acceptable and i would meet with my manager i would request a one on one with at least an hour set aside , and i would go through points that demonstrates that the negative feedback is not warranted i would volunteer for such a project as there would be a lot of interaction with the norway client , but i would not have to travel out of the country i would imagine a lot of interaction through conferencing software so that would be interesting i also like the idea of learning about a country and culture as part of a work project
i would ask the supervisor who put in the request first i would then tell the supervisor whoever put the request in first should get to take the vacation i would then be the one who got to take my vacation because i know i would of put in for the request at least 2 months in adavance while on vacation i would take annoyingly bragging photos to send to my colleague each day i would start my project immediately i would get it done as soon as possible so that way i was prepared for the deadline also if my boss gave me any last minute tasks i would have time to do them without putting to much stress on myself i would go ahead and go to the network meeting , it is always good to get more involved in the comapny you work for so that way you can advance i would go and socialize and introduce myself to as many people as i could i would let my manager know how i felt explain to them how they are wrong in a polite manner i wouldnt be discouraged by this i know my abilities and my work ethic and if the manager doesnt agree i would show them how they have misviewed me i would find this experience enjoyable and i would volunteer i think it always good to be more involved in your work so i would learn all i could about norway and if i could travel i would
i would make the sacrifice i would make sure my colleague is aware as well as my boss i would make sure that they know the next time this happens , i will get the vacation i would make sure to finish the project early this would allow time if unexpected items are thrown my way finishing early will leave more time for the unexpected i would go even though i was going by myself it would make me look good to the client i would do my best to fit in and get to know the client i would be confused as a result i would go to my manager to find out what i did wrong i would also ask if there was anything i could do to improve i would show initiative i would find it enjoyable it would help break up the mundane work schedule and give some new things to take part in it would also give me the upper hand in knowledge
if i had requested my vacation first i would push back a little bit to try to get them to switch otherwise i would try to see if we could compromise and each have half of the week off as originally planned and take before or after off i would not be happy if i had to completely reschedule but i probably would to keep a job i would try to manage my time appropriately i would do this by starting to work harder on the project that is due in two weeks to account for any last minute tasks that might take extra time i would do this because it would prevent having a miserable last couple days trying to accomplish too much at once i think it 's important to go because it 's one of our largest clients i would force myself to go so that our company is represented even though i might have less fun there without my colleague i think work would be very disappointed if we both bailed and that might lead to bad things i think i would ask them why they feel that way or where they heard the information from \( politely \) if i better understood why they were giving the negative feedback it would give me something to be able to give my opinion on why it 's not true or improve my performance i think it 's worth saying something given that there are real consequences for the situation not sharing feelings is n't going to fix anything i think i would find this experience enjoyable because it would let you interact with another country it would be less enjoyable because i might not necessarily get to go there and travel to use it in person and see the country in person i do n't think there 's anything to lose by learning the culture and about the country if anything it might make you more valuable at work
i would be very angry with my colleague i would probably go talk to hr about this situation and try to find a resolution i would explain how this is extremely unfair to me and why my colleague got special treatment i would stop messing around and try to find ways that my supervisor would assign me the additional tasks so that i can get ahead i would email them asap to try and get the tasks assigned earlier i definitely would not wait until the last minute i would be frustrated with my colleague i would try and convince persuade them to come with me to the networking meeting i would probably offer to buy them lunch or a beer after work i do not want to go alone i would immediately speak to my manager about the situation and try to iron things out hopefully , this will go well and show that i care about their feedback and will continue to work better if they do n't agree , i suppose i would have to swallow my pride and lose my annual bonus if they were being unfair , i would go to hr as soon as possible to explain the situation if all else goes south , i will leave the company i would find the experience extremely enjoyable because doing something like this for work is very out of the norm i would like to learn about a new culture to help the company with the project it would be even better if i was able to go over there
i would change my vacation if i did n't have any plans if i had plans i would go ask my manager to approve and tell him i already have paid for certain things and can not get a refund i would do this because it is true i would work on this project whenever i got time i would not want to risk not finishing the project it would be hard but i could do it i would not go i would want to go back to my family since i was already working late i do n't think i would need to go i would feel very hurt i would first talk to my manager and let him know that i disagree and get some explanation on it if i did not like what i hear i would go to his manager and talk to him about the situation i would find it enjoyable it would be fun to learn something new about a country it would also broaden my knowledge
i would have to change my vacation i would tell my supervisor and colleague that i will do it this time , but next time my colleague needs to let me select my vacation first i would do the project right away i want to have time to do it right i want to have time for the last minute jobs too i want to keep my boss happy i would ask my colleague to reconsider i would ask my manager if he could go instead , since i need to return home to my family i would hope that i do not need to go i would feel shocked i would talk with my manager i would show my manager all of my accomplishments for the company i would not want to lose my annual bonus i would feel confident that i could change my manager 's mind about this i would find it enjoyable i would like to learn about norway i like new countries and cultures
i would try to make a simple appeal on who asked for this vacation first that might be sufficient to receive a favorable response from my supervisor , if i was indeed the first to request this time off failing that , i would try to reason with my colleague to see if perhaps some kind of arrangement could be made perhaps \( s \) he would offer something in return for this vacation time , or would allow me to take it in return for some other favor at work if all else failed , i would recognize that it is my responsibility to help out at work during a busy time , so i would reschedule my vacation however , i would ask for something in return for the disruption this had caused to my vacation plans perhaps some extra time off during a slower period i would try to get ahead on the project , in case any of these surprise tasks distract me later that is to say , i would try to do as much of the work on this scheduled project as soon as possible , so that i can maintain a light workload in the days leading up to the deadline i would also try to anticipate my boss 's last minute demands by giving regular updates on my progress , and reiterating how important it is that i continue to work with the same guidelines and expectations for the final finished product if any changes did occur , i would have time to work on them , but i would have to stress that so much work had already been done , under the original guidelines i would still attend the networking event , even without my colleague if \( s \) he actually does attend , then i would probably stay for the whole event , and try to encourage this coworker to join me in networking if i was alone , however , i would still check out the event , but with considerably less enthusiasm this may turn out to be a valuable opportunity to meet with employees at the client company , but if early signs were not encouraging , i would just leave early it would be better for me to recharge for the next day at my job than to spend a weary night networking with people who are not interested in meeting me i would try , guardedly , to argue my own case in this situation if my boss offered specifics , i would try to offer some evidence to show that perhaps \( s \) he was being too negative with the feedback perhaps the boss thought i was n't contributing enough to a team project , but i had a lot of notes showing my work along the way i might also try to show how extenuating circumstances might have caused a poor performance despite my best efforts in sum , i would try to rebut this negative feedback , but only in a respectful , truthful , and evidence based way i would find this experience enjoyable , even if the thought of actually traveling to norway is not very attractive to me i do enjoy learning about other cultures , and coincidentally , i am already quite interested in scandinavia i would volunteer for this project , and then find a travel documentary about norway , and read some general history of the country online from there , any more focused research would just be a slightly interesting , though otherwise routine , part of my regular duties
i would talk to the colleague to make my own assessment of how time sensitive his plans are if his her plans are pretty tied to that week but my plans are not , i would strongly consider asking for a different week if my plans are more dependent on that week that the colleague 's , i would continue negotiating with the colleague to see if i could convince him or her to change if i was unable to negotiate an appropriate outcome i would ask the supervisor to help mediate a solution i would make sure that the boss knew about the impending deadline then i would let the boss know that i was beginning my final push toward that deadline and ask that i be given as much advance notice as possible if he she would like to put something else on my plate then i would determine whether there was anybody else in the organization that could be ready to either help me with my project or help with a last minute additional project if the boss assigns something i 'd make sure it was obvious that i was working toward the project deadline i would buck up and get ready to go while i certainly appreciate having friends or acquaintances that i am familiar with in social setting , i do n't think that not knowing anyone is an adequate reason to avoid a legitimate social engagement i 'd visualize meeting some new and or interesting contacts at the networking event and make sure i looked good and presentable i would think again , strongly asking myself if there 's any kernel of truth to the feedback if i remained convince that the negative feedback was inaccurate , i 'd ask myself if the feedback seemed more accurate from what i perceive to be the manager 's point of view i 'd then make sure that the disagreement was adequately documented if i determined that the feedback was truly unfair , i might try to escalate the matter to a shared supervisor , but otherwise i would ask the manager to help me document concrete suggestions about how to improve my performance i would find the experience enjoyable in general , i enjoy using both objective facts and my own subjective perceptions to try to understand others' positions i 'd welcome the opportunity to learn more about norway , and i 'd consider myself lucky that i might benefit at my job from doing well at such a task
i would be annoyed and want to keep my vacation i would ask my boss who put the request in first if it was my colleague , i 'd change my plans if it was me , i 'd ask my boss to treat this as a first come first serve scenario i would be pretty nervous about getting a last minute task i would let me boss know i wanted to put optimum time and effort into the task to subtly say i did n't want any more projects i 'd try to get the task done as quick as possible in case he did not take the hint i would be pretty nervous however , i 'd force myself to go for the networking opportunities this could be chance to meet big clients and stake a name for myself this would make me really nervous i would ask to speak to my manager directly about why exactly the feedback was given , and to share my side of the story i would explain my concerns about the consequences and ask how to improve so as to keep my bonus i would love to do this ! i love learning about new cultures , and this seems different from typical work tasks i would find it enjoyable and try my hardest to get the chance to travel norway is supposed to be beautiful !
i would be a good sport and agree to take my vacation later i do n't like conflict , and do n't need conflict at my workplace i would expect my colleague to believe that he she owes me one , though i would try to finish the project well before the due date , but keep it quiet and pretend that i am still working hard on it then , if my boss shows up with a last minute task , i can negotiate something , maybe and i would be able to complete the task i hate networking , even though i understand the importance of it if my colleague does n't go , i would n't go either i am tired already , and in this state spending an hour or two with unfamiliar people would be pain i would go back to my office \( or is it a cubicle \? \) and punch the cardboard figure of my boss a few times then , i would sit down and think how to present my case to the boss , or even better , to his superior , to explain why they got it wrong it 's very unfair to treat employees like that i would find this experience neither boring nor enjoyable it 's part of my job , and if it has to be done , the it will be done norway or whatever , i would learn things that need to be learned and got the job done
i would be the bigger person and change my vacation time something like that is not worth fighting over or making a big scene about unless money was spent on a big vacation , i would ask my supervisor who requested off first i would get the project done way before the due date based on previous experience from what the boss does , it would make sense to start earlier rather than later if i get the job done early i would have time to review and perfect it i would try and convince my colleague on going i would tell them about all the potentials of networking with people who know one of our largest clients if my colleague does n't go , i would go by myself and network , even if it is a little uncomfortable sometimes you have to make sacrifices i would ask for some clarification about the feedback i would tell my manager that i respect their feedback but agree to disagree i would also ask for ways in which i could improve , showing that i care i would find this experience quite enjoyable i love learning about other people 's culture and way of life i would actually prefer to travel
i would most likely let my co worker have the vacation , unless there was a reason that i really needed the vacation days i would also make sure that for next year i would have my vacation request in as soon as possible to avoid this conflict next year life 's too short to worry over the small stuff in my opinion i also would let my co worker know that i have done this i would get at least get a good start on the project , as i do n't like to leave things to the last minute and then scramble around i would do this to ensure that i could deliver a completed project on time i would also anticipate that 'extra' work could come my way at any time , and work on the project accordingly i would go to the meeting anyway , and use it as it was intended to make new contacts i feel it would be a good career move to meet with the client as opposed to blowing off the meeting even if i initially did n't know anyone there , i feel sure that i would be ok with the clients not going might not be such a wise career move in my opinion as for the long day , that is pretty much an non issue for me i would ask to speak with the manager in a closed door meeting i would like to find out the reason for the bad feedback i also would likely want to know where and how they came up with it i would also discuss it in reasonable and adult forms i would find this very enjoyable i really like to learn new things and learning about a country and a culture would be fascinating to me even though travel is n't a given , i would be up to travelling to norway if it was needed it also would give some possibly valuable insights as to how other countries do business
apperenly i have a choice in the matter it would seem unfair to bend to thier demands but this is life i will wait patienly for my time off to cleared by the manager since the project is easy and i have the time i will take in bite size chunks i will do it easilly managed sections in case others jobs come again i was given plenty of time wok on the project and will gladly handle it this is not a matter of choice even though you colleague thinks so it is customer servce toward an important client does not matter if do n't know anybody , it is the job that you have and they client is your paycheck i would fee really bad and seek to learn from others of the feedback is true or not if the feedback is true i would see to learn how to improve and correct the problems if the feed back is false i seek to correct the false feed back from the manager taking a new client no matter where they are from is always healthy so i would take it on my willingess to take resonibliy would lead to more responility and where that leads me
i would ask my colleague to reconsider their choice because i would want to go on my vacation but if my colleague is still being difficult , i would just change my week to another week it would n't be deal to me because i would n't want to damper my vacation mindset with drama of work i would make sure that my project is done first knowing that my boss is the type to give me extra work , i would n't want to risk not making my due date so i would finish the project first and then take on any extra work i would convince my colleague to go to the meeting with me because the client is important i know that my colleague would see the importance of going and agree to go with me if they were to be difficult , i would just promise to help them out after with their work load i would try to understand the feedback of my manager and try to reason with it i would also be confident with my work and not let a misunderstanding damper my mood i would also make sure to fix the situation where both my boss and myself would be happy with the work i would find this experience to be rewarding because i would like to learn about new cultures i like to learn about other cultures and countries because i find them interesting i would n't mind not travelling because i would like to stay with my family more rather than worrying about travelling for work
i would be willing to compromise with my coworker if they give me an assurance that they wo n't take their next vacation during my vacation time i would be reasonable and try to be friendly and kind i would seek to make a friend out of a difficult situation i would make sure to carve out time in my calendar for potential workarounds i would also talk to my coworkers to ensure that i have the proper support i would also create a project plan that builds in contingencies i would go because it 's my responsibility i would understandably be annoyed because it would be great to have support however , i would put in extra prep time in order to be ready for the meeting i would ask to have a separate meeting with my manager to build a performance improvement plan i would ask her for feedback and suggestions i would also try to see if there was an additional outlet for me to gain skills , such as training i would love this experience i thrive on learning , especially when it comes to other countries and cultures i would enjoy delving into norwegian culture in order to improve my career standing
i would talk to the supervisor and tell them i will reschedule my vacation time for a more convenient time i would be happy with that i would treat the project as a normal project and do my best i would not worry about any extra work until it becomes a hassle i would assume my colleague would probably not go i would try my best to impress the clients if and when it comes to that i would accept the managers feedback i would try to correct the problem and go on i would definitely volunteer for the project i would think it would be interesting and informative
i would find out who asked first for vacation time after which , if the other had been precipitous then it would be only right that they would go at their time if , i had been the one who 'd asked first then i would require the supervisor to instate a change i would finish as best as i could in a short time in the time remaining , i would either spend going back over the work or move on to other duties i would also ask the supervisor if they foresaw any new tasks i would definitely go i do n't see why not to i would not necessarily look for anyone else either i would step back and analyze the feedback if it truly was not warranted , then i would confront the supervisor for explanation i would then try to chande the feedback or go above them in ranking i would not find it particularly interesting unless i was going to travel information not put into practice is rather boring i would try and campaign for travel related work as part of the bargain
i would change my plans i would n't think highly of my colleague because of how selfish they responded in order to not be upset all my colleague would have to do is explain to me why it is important to them to have that particular week off if the excuse was n't valid than i really would n't associate with that person anymore and i would keep my distance at all costs i would be the bigger one though and just move my vacation to another week i think overall it would show me in a different light with my boss i would work as hard as i could on the project in the beginning i would n't wait until the last minute just in case my boss did throw another assignment my way it 's better to have more time towards the end then to be bombarded and being upset with yourself knowing that you could have started on that project earlier and prevented the chaos i would go anyway , but i would be hesitant i would say some prayers and try to handle my anxiety the best i could i know it would be for my benefit , and that is why i would choose to go usually my anxiety goes away after i am in the location i'm worried about anyway and things usually go better than expected i am really quiet so initially i would listen to everything my boss had to say if i disagreed with something that i knew for a fact that was n't true i would speak up and say something i would more than likely hold back tears and after i left the talk with my boss i would probably cry a bit or just feel down i would seek ways to improve what i was slacking on or if i disagreed completely i would still remain quiet and i would search for another job i would find this experience very enjoyable it would be very interesting to learn about a new country and culture i would have to make sure i had the time to invest into it , but overall the experience would improve my intelligence it would even provide me with an opportunity to meet new people , which i feel is very important
i would talk with my spouse about changing the week of our vacation if he is set on that particular week , i would discuss it with my supervisor i would also discuss it with my co worker i would probably take the work home with me and do some of it at home i would also do some overtime to get ahead of the project i might ask my boss if he she believes he she might have other tasks coming up i would find out if spouses are allowed to attend with me so that i will have someone that i know there i would go home and take a shower to get refreshed for the meeting i would try to talk my colleague into going to the meeting i would be very angry i would discuss this situation further with my manager to try to find out why i was given this feedback and try to explain to them why i feel it 's untrue if that does n't work , i would make a log and go to the human resources department i would find this experience enjoyable as i like reading up on the culture of other countries i believe that this could also get my foot in the door for a promotion
i would pick a different week because i usually do n't have any major things scheduled for my vacationsi would get as much done on the project as i could as soon as it was assigned then i could fine tune the rest of it closer to the deadline and still have time for last minute requests from the boss i'm not afraid of being in a room full of strangers i would definitely go to the meeting and network with the people there i know it would be a good opportunity for me i would gather the facts that support my position that the manager was unfair , then sit down and talk with the manager in a nonconfrontational way to state my case and see if they might reconsider their criticism it would be an interesting experience right now i do n't know much about that country and it 's always good to learn about other cultures
i would probably change my vacation plans it would show my boss i'm flexible and provide the possibility of my colleague returning a favor if i need one later i would get my project done early so i can be ready , just in case my boss throws some last minute tasks my way i would encourage my client to attend even if she says no , i would go alone even though i do n't know anyone there , i would take the chance to get to know my client better and to meet new potential clients i would ask my manager for specifics i would then ask if i could get back to her in 24 hours if she says yes , i would try to find documented evidence to counter her feedback if she says no , i would ask for her advice on how to improve i would find this experience enjoyable because i love to learn about new cultures it would also show my boss my ambition
i would ask my colleague if he booked anywhere to stay also did he need a flight to get to his destination if it was n't a big deal i would just make plans to take the other time off from work i would make the effort to do as much as i could with the project if i has the extra time i would put that towards working on it i would rather be ahead of it than be scrambling at the last moment i would just make the effort to go by myself if it was going to be a help to the the company then i would tell myself it was important once there , i would make the effort to get to know people i would ask my manager what was the problem with the work i would point out some of the positive things that i thought were good then i would ask what i could have done to make it better i would find this to be an enjoyable deal it would be interesting to learn about a different country , language and all the culture i would think it would be very interesting
if i was able to change my plans then i would unless it was a family emergency or if tickets were already bought , i would try very hard to accomodate my co worker if for any reason that i could not change my plans , i would inform my supervisor that i was unable to change my plans there may be a financial burden after this fiasco , i would ensure that my work partner and i better coordinate our vacation times i would definitely not wait until the last minute to begin this project by starting the project early , it will give me time to do a thorough job , and ensure my work is accurate just because a supervisor gives you a deadline does not mean you should wait until the very last minute to complete it and turn it i would convince my colleague to go , but if my colleague still received to go , i believe i would still go to the networking event i would promise myself to at least go for at least a half hour who knows , i might actually have a good time , meet some new clients , and possibly advance my career if the event was awful i would make my rounds leave , and then make sure my colleague who bailed on me owes me a huge favor i would definitely attempt to continue discussing the issue with my supervisor if it was a flaw that others see in me , then i would definitely attempt to correct this flaw this time it might be the bonus , but if i do not take corrective actions i might actually lose my job if i completely disagreed with my supervisors and the situation over time did not improve , i would begin to search for new employment i would find it enjoyable one of the things i love to do is travel , and learn about new cultures although i do not have to travel , you never know what will happen in the future if i show my supervisors how knowledgeable i have become regarding the client , in the future i may just get selected to go to norway if the opportunity arose
i would not be willing to change my plans either , unless i had not yet made the plans final and i could work it into my schedule to take the vacation another time i 'd say i 'd be more flexible than the other person , just because i would want to avoid a conflict and make it work the best i could i would take control of my time by being sure that i anticipate any last minute tasks or assignments , and work harder than usual on the project in order to be sure that it 's finished on time i would do this because it would seem obviously to be the best way to handle it i would not go because it would be a lot of excess energy spent with people i'm not familiar with it would not be worth the energy or the benefits after having a long day and i would prefer to go home i would take the feedback to my manager 's supervisor , or even to hr to dispute it and prove however i could that the feedback is not accurate i would do this because it 's important to be your own biggest supporter and if i do n't do it , who will \? i would find this experience to be a combination of both in some ways it may be boring , but in others it would be enjoyable to learn about a different culture and broaden my horizons i would lean toward it being more enjoyable because it ca n't hurt
i would have my supervisor handle it that is why they are the supervisor , to deal with stuff like that i should not be required to change my plans just because my colleague is stubborn vacation can be decided based on any number of factors including seniority , previous amounts of vacation taken that year , as a reward for hard work , etc my responsibility is to my supervisor and company , not to my colleague i would try to get the project done as soon as possible i like to get things out of the way , especially work things that way i have time to troubleshoot , and if i do n't need to troubleshoot i can just enjoy having nothing hanging over my head also , that way i would be prepared if the boss added any last minute tasks i would plan on attending at least for a little while it does n't bother me to be at an event with strangers worst case , it is uncomfortable and i leave soon after arriving best case , i still get the networking benefits from attending i would talk to the manager and ask for an explanation about the feedback if it was true , i would work to improve myself if it was false , i would take it up with someone above my manager if my company had an hr department , i could also go that route if i felt the feedback was unwarranted untrue i would find this experience neither enjoyable or boring based on the information given without knowing the scope of the project , i do n't know whether the effort needed would outweigh the benefit so if the work was average , i would probably find it enjoyable but if the workload was heavy and or boring , i would not find the experience enjoyable i have no burning desire to learn things about norway , it would be passive enjoyment at most
i would change my vacation date it would be a nice thing to do plus it does n't interfere with my plans hopefully this will work out for both of us i would get it done this has happened before i 'll just do a little extra everyday this is somewhat stressful , but i know i can do it i would prefer not to go but if needed i would this would be good for myself and our company it would be ok if this was n't a ongoing thing i would be very distressed i would try to resolve this situation get proof to prove otherwise i would find this interesting i enjoy learning about other places norway is one of them plus i do n't need to travel for this !
i would be willing to change my plans , but would expect something in return i would attempt to negotiate for an extra day 's vacation or some other small reward for making the change i would do this because i believe in compromise , give and take , and being rewarded for doing the right thing i would stay in constant connection with my boss to make sure she knew that i have the project that is due i would probably keep giving subtle clues and hints that i am not available for additional tasks i would also make sure i finished the project as early as possible why \? because communication , planning and being prepared are the only way to avoid a conflict in this situation i would try to talk my colleague into going , if only for a short while i would prefer if she came along , for the sake of her career as well as my own , but if she ended up not going , i would go anyway , because you can never have too many chances to network i would be very upset i would gather as many facts and data as possible , and schedule a meeting with my boss to make sure she was aware that the feedback may be faulty i would be persistent i would find this very enjoyable , and i would probably begin studying norwegian on my own right away the opportunity to learn more could lead to new opportunities and maybe travel in the future
i would negotiate with my colleague first to figure out who can be a priority to take this vacation week if my colleague cannot change their vacation plans i would reschedule my plans to take another week or i would ask another colleague to take my job duty during this week and i will also do it for he she later on first , i would try my best until the last minutes to finish the project second , if the boss gives me tasks in last minutes and i feel that i could not spend much time to do it i would ask he she to delay it until i finish my project third , if it is possible i would ask to extend the due date of the project because i want to be done perfectly not due to due date pressure first , i would not ask he she to go with me if they do n't want second , i would not worry that i will not have anyone to talk there as i could make friend with someone at the meeting third , my purpose in the meeting is to meet my clients , so i would go for it and do not be bothered if my colleague will go or not i would feel bad about the feedback i would go to talk directly with the manager to figure out what reasons if the manager 's responses are not right or satisfy me i would look for responses from the higher boss i would love to volunteer on this opportunity although it takes time on my job i love to discover new things and on our clients this chance could be a good experience for me to deal with future clients
i would probably let them take the vacation time if it was n't anything i could reschedule i would also let them know that they owe me i do n't think i would particularly be mad or upset as i am a flexible person i would try to plan out how to execute my task i would go over any information given to me i then would take notes on what i need to do i think this would work so i could lessen the stress on me i would probably try to convince them to go by letting them know i would do a favor for them if they just really declined i would probably go by myself i would n't like to miss out on my clients meeting i would probably feel upset i would try my best to not say anything to lose my bonus if i did feel the need to say something i would say it very calmly i would probably find this experience enjoyable i like to learn about other cultures i would also take this as an opportunity to get to know my client better
i would ask for a meeting with the 3 of us in attendance to discuss the vacation conflict i would point out that i had requested my vacation time well in advance and it has been on the calendar for about a month while my colleague requested the same vacation week only a week ago without checking the vacation calendar or just disregarding it if push came to shove and i could , i would pull rank and seniority as my workload is light and this project is on my desk , i would work on the project completing prior to the deadline then , i would do a thorough review of my work and correct any thing that needed correcting or issue a written explanation of the result analysis completing ahead of deadline prepares me to assume additional tasks as necessary and gives review time as well as upper management respond well to this , dependable to get the job done waiting until the last minute and rushing through is not my work ethic and style whether my colleague goes or not is immaterial , i would attend the networking meeting solo this is because it is good to know members of a client 's team especially those related to my department for future job related interaction this also gives me the opportunity to meet members of the client 's team that i would not otherwise have contact with these types of activities are good for career building i would be very disappointed however i would respond with counters to the negative feedback i would do this by addressing , at a minimum , the key points by providing examples of my work and competency of those tasks with any written feedback available i would also discuss any policy changes i was not notified of that related to my performance \( job responsibilities \) , including timing \( after the fact \) , etc if , at that point i was not satisfied with any response i would go above my manager and issue a formal complaint i would volunteer to be a part of this project this is because it would provide an opportunity to learn about another country as well as give me visibility to higher management levels within the organization volunteering for these types of projects is good for my career
i would talk to them about why they need that week in particular if there is a reason that it ca n't be another week , then i would reschedule if there was no valid reason , i would suggest the supervisor flip a coin i do n't like to put things off , if i know what is expected and when it is due i would get started on it right away knowing my boss sometimes adds to my load , it would be unprofessional for me to not use this time wisely to accomplish my task i would go and use the opportunity to expand my network i would introduce myself to people and get to know new people and clients not going because i had to go alone does not make good business sense i would ask to sit down with the manager and ask them to explain the reasoning behind the feedback i would ask them for advice for improvement and would also express my reasoning for why i believe the feedback is inaccurate i would find the experience very interesting i love to learn new things and would welcome the opportunity to get to know more about another place expressing an interest to the client in learning about their culture would be good for business as well
i would talk to my family members and see if a different week would work for my vacation i would also talk to the colleage and find out why they are not willing to change their vacation plans and see if we could avoid something like this in the future so that we do n't have to change our plans at the last minute i would most likely end up changing my request for vacation to a different week because i do n't like conflict and confrontation i would try to make things work and be flexible because i think things are better in life if you can have some flexibility i would look at the work that i know i need to get done , even if it is light i would try to get as much of that work done as possible because i know that my boss could give me some time consuming tasks at the end and i want to have the time to complete them i would also talk to my boss and ask if i could know any sooner if there will be additional tasks that will need to be done on the project so that i could get a start on them right away if my boss does n't let me know of the tasks , then i would just try my best with what i have , making sure to get done what i know i can get done i would think about the pros and cons of going to the meeting so that i could decide if going to the meeting would be the best option i would probably find out that there are more pros to going to the meeting and then end up going to the meeting i think getting to know one of the largest clients could help me in my job , and would be a good use of time , even if i am worn out and it is towards the end of the day i think that i may end up with many benefits if i end up going to the meeting , and would go i would feel very frustrated about the situation and would want to try and resolve this as soon as possible i would see if i could meet with my manager to discuss the feedback i want to talk with my manager to understand why i got the negative feedback and then if it is not accurate , to tell what i believe to be the truth i also want to discuss the consequences of the feedback with my manager to see if there is anything that i can do to make things better i would find this experience enjoyable i think that learning about another country and culture as part of work is something that would be ejoyable and maybe entertaining i think that the opportunity to learn more is a good thing and would help me overall as a person , not just in this work setting i would not really want to travel , and would hope that i did n't have to travel , but it says the person would n't necessairly need to travel so as long as i did n't have to travel , i would find this enjoyable
