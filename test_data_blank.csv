If that failed, I would accept that I did not make the request in time and that the other worker made his request first.","I would try to work on the project quickly and get as much done as possible.  I would not necessarily disclose how far I am on the project to my boss so that I could have the buffer of time to do other activity.  In other words, I would plan as if he will give me added last-minute tasks and only disclose how far along I am with the project as I get almost complete with it.","I would try to make a case with my colleague to attend the meeting.  I'd suggest it could help both of us from a career perspective.  I might also suggest we go to dinner or have drinks to make it more enjoyable (and offer to pay).  If that failed, I would go alone and network with others for the first time.","I would try to get some objective information that proves this feedback to be false.  I would gather this on my own as well as through discussions with others.  I would also work on a plan to address the deficiencies in the event he/she cannot be dissuaded from their position.

It might even lead to travel to Norway either for business or on a personal level.,,,,,

It's not easy considering we usually take cruises and book them 9 months ahead of time, but I am always willing to work with employers.

This way, I would have plenty of time to iron out the problems leading up to the date in a leisurely fashion. Also, if my boss gives me more things to do, I would not feel like I was in the ""hot seat"" to get everything done last minute.","I would go to the function anyways. I would like to not only make myself look good with my company, but network with other professionals in my field. This is a great chance to get to know the people we work for.","I would do everything in my power to appear as though I'm making progress on his feedback. I love negative feedback, true or not, since that is my opportunity to show much improvement. If it's impossible to improve, I am talented at appearing ""improved.""","I would find this experience very enjoyable and engaging.

I could also gain a little more perspective, too.",,,,,

I would tell the guy to pick another week because I have already got that week and I am not giving it up,"I would start working on the project right away.  I would focus on the hardest part of the project first.  As time goes on I would have most of it done.  That way if I the boss comes to me later with something else to do, I will have the majority of the first job finished",I would try to convince him to go.  I would explain that nor going may hurt us in the long run.  I would tell then that this may further us in our career.  Also it may get us further to get a raise then if we don't go.,I would ask to get to the bottom of what I thought was wrong.  I would ask for their help in figuring out why the truth is not being told.  I would have colleagues come forward if they have information.  I wouldn't just let it go especially if I knew what I was being told was a lie,I would probably enjoy it.  I am sure most would.  I would not do it because I have way to much going on in my life.  I am not going to add anymore onto my plate then I already have and take away time from my family.,,,,,

In my opinion, I think he should not express it directly he is not willing to change their vacation plans.",I would try to handle all the projects and be done with them as fast as possible.  In case my boss will give me a last minute task I would not want to be stressed about having too many tasks to do.  I prefer a stress free environment.,I would feel anxious about going alone there and not knowing anyone.  I would still go without my colleague.  It is a big meeting with one of the largest clients and might benefit the company and me.,I would feel very frustrated in this situation.  I would go and speak with my manager and explain everything.  I'll bring any necessary documents or facts to prove that the feedback was unfair.,I would find this experience enjoyable because I'm always up to try new things.  I like having new experiences and this might be helpful learning about a new culture.,,,,,

And I sure wouldn't waste my time learning country and culture things that I have no interest in.",,,,,
10459710368,I would take action depending on the situation. I believe whoever requested the vaction first should have it. If it was the colleague who requested first I would let them have it and reschedule mine. If I requested first I would stand my ground and explain the my boss I had requested first therefor I should have it.,I would first make sure that my project is done early. That way if My boss give last minute tasks I can be ready. If my project is already done then I can put all my time and resources into the last minute tasks.,I would still go. Even if my colleague decides no to go I wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity. I wouldn't let the fact that I don't know anyone there stop me from going.  It's a network meeting so I would get to know people.,I would bring it up to my manager to see what I could do. I would approach them with reasons why I dont agree and try to make a reasonable argument.

If his plans are fixed, and mine are not, I would take a different week of vacation. In contrast, if my vacation plans could not be changed but he had nothing planned, I would try to get my boss to approve my vacation time for that week but not his. I would determine which one of us (me or my colleague) submitted their request for time off first, and if I submitted first I would use that for additional leverage to get my time off approved for that week.","I would try to complete the project early, since at the moment my workload is light and I have little else to accomplish. By aiming to complete the project early, I will be prepared if any parts of the project (particularly the last tasks) take significantly longer than expected. I will also be prepared in case any new project or other issue requiring my attention comes up in the next two weeks. Since my workload is light, completing the project early will not be a problem.","I would go to the networking meeting anyway. It is one of our largest clients so even if I don't know anyone there, I should introduce myself and meet the clients. I would ask my colleague to go with me to make the introductions, but I would go to the meeting either way.","I would be unsure whether the feedback is legitimate or is fabricated for the purpose of the company not having to pay out my annual bonus. I would first determine if there was any reason the manager might have incorrect information about my work that led to incorrect feedback. I would also check with colleagues to see if they agreed with the feedback, and I was simply unaware of the problem. If I determined the feedback were legitimate, I would work to correct the problem. If I determined the feedback were illegitimate, I would leave the company.","I would find this experience very enjoyable. I like learning about different cultures, and I also like learning new languages. I imagine in this role, I would have to learn about Norwegian culture extensively, and presumably learn at least some terms in the language, which I would find enjoyable. I also enjoy interacting with clients, so if the project involved client interaction I would enjoy that as well.",,,,,
10440110921,I would change my requested week for vacation. This would give me a view of being willing to make changes for the good of the company.,I would complete the project early so that I would have time available for any last tasks that my boss might assign.

I would think it would be good, ethical, hardworking, and fair for me to do that.","I would want to work on the task as soon as I can. I would try to schedule this so it can be done in advance. It would cause a problem if my boss gave me a task to do at the last second, and I didn't have this project finished.","I would be sure to have a private conversation with my colleague. I would want for the person to understand the situation and how I view things.

I can work on this project and polish it off. That way, if the boss comes to me with another task, I will be more able--timewise--to work on this project in its own time.","I would definitely reach out to my colleague(s). With my gentle coax, more people might attend. Even if no one else in my office would go, I would be in attendance. But it would be best to have a more plentiful showing with several greeters for our clients.","I would not go home that day without speaking with my manager. On my break, I would spend the time researching the points of feedback which are not true. I will gather evidence to show this. And I will definitely make it plain that the feedback I received is not true because of the evidence I present. Of course I need to be friendly rather than preachy, but this can be difficult when  you are hurt and your actions misunderstood.",I would welcome the opportunity to learn some new things about this country and culture. I would go to Duolingo online to begin learning the language of the Norwegian people. It would also be enjoyable to travel if it became necessary.,,,,,
10462866873,I would change my vacation plans to avoid conflict. I do not want to put the company in a bad place and its not worth it to me to argue with a colleague over vacation time. I am pretty flexible,"I would have to just work harder to finish the work assigned to me. Since I know this is a recurring habit of my boss, I would have mentally prepared to add more to my workload. I would work hard on the project but ask my boss for a raise.",I would still go to the event. This is more important to my career then feeling comfortable at the event. The whole point is to network and create new connections so I would just go and try to do so. I would be friendly and social.,I would feel very upset. I would think it is extremely unfair. I would probably complain to someone that was above my manager and show them my good track record at work. I would ask my manager why they gave me negative feedback and see if there was anything i can do to change it.,I would find this experience to be very enjoyable. I think it is a good chance to learn new things that might be helpful in the future. It is also a good chance to make a good impression on both the client and the company I work for. It would be interesting to learn about a new culture.,,,,,
10459825177,"It depends. If my plans were malleable, I would probably just reschedule my vacation. If my plans depended on this time period, I would try to negotiate with my colleague or offer them something in exchange. Or, if I had asked first for the time off, I would pressure my boss to give me the days.",I would go ahead and start the project early. I don't like being pressed for time. I especially don't want to have extra work to do on top of it at the last minute.,"It depends on how important this meeting is and whether it would benefit me personally to go. Or whether it would hurt my career reputation to miss it. If I didn't think I would be negatively affected, I would skip it and go home.","I have been in this situation. I would just keep doing my best, take the negative feedback into consideration and try to show more effort in that area even if I don't agree with the assessment, and see if I could improve my reviews. If I lost my bonus or something I would probably talk to someone higher up.",So very enjoyable! I would ask to go to Norway and would pay some of my own expenses. I would learn basic Norse. It would be a great deal of fun for me. I travel whenever I can for enjoyment.,,,,,
10459953492,I would talk to the supervisor about it and if the other employee had put in for vacation first I would change my plans.

I would take one for the team and go without him.","I would have a conversation with the supervisor and ask for constructive criticism so I can be a better employee. I would voice my opinions where I think I was right, but I would learn from this mistake and be better next time.",I would find it enjoyable. It would be nice to learn about another culture maybe another language. It would be a good career move as well.,,,,,
10460189173,"I would tell him that I have requested the same vacation time as his, so he would be aware that I needed that vacation as well.  I would ask him if he could suspend it for another week or so if his need for this vacation is really very important then maybe he could give in to my request and delayed to another week.  But if his need for his vacation is really more important than mine then I would let him take this vacation and just delay mine to another time. Better communication and understanding others with a ""give and take"" relationship in a workplace is very important.","I would ask the boss if I could help him in this project since I'm quite confident that I have the ability to handle it. By doing so I would be able to prove that I can handle the extra workload, many more options will become available to me and would also be an opportunity to advance my career.","I would accept the invitation to attend the networking meeting since this is one of our important and largest clients. It doesn't matter if I do not know anyone there,  but this is a great opportunity to meet other important people in the industry and this meeting could help me prove my ability and thus further help me in advancing in my career.",I would take the negative feedback with an open mind and an opportunity to prove my manager that he was wrong with the negative feedback that he gave me.  I would work harder and listen well to all the details that the manager had given me so I would know in details what are his expectations and how I could improve my work and prove him that I'm interested to learn. Then I would thank him for bringing it to my attention.,I would volunteer to be involved in the project myself.

This will help me advance in my career and you never know that in the future it will help me build my portfolio.,,,,,
10442507295,"I would talk to my colleague first.  If their plans are non negotiable and mine are, I'd be willing to switch. But I would make sure my colleague knew I was doing them a favor.","I would give daily updates to my manager, stressing the project due date and the importance of completing on time.  If my manager tried to give me a last minute project, I would use those updates as a way to impress that I need to finish this important project.",I would attend on my own. I am a professional and don't need a colleague to go with me.  I will be able to handle this event with an important client by myself.,I would take some time to calm down before doing anything.  Then I would gather evidence to counteract the claim.  I would sit down with the manager and try to rectify the situation but not be confrontational. I'd frame it as a learning experience.,I would find the process of investigating a new culture and country fascinating!  It would be enjoyable to learn new things and share them with the client. I believe my new found knowledge would be valuable to my company.,,,,,
10440105759,"I would try to talk to them about works that have to be done right before the trip. I want to compare rather there or my assignments are more argent to be done.

I believe it will also lead me into the right direction in my career. I will be a stronger employee for this company and even for myself on a personal level.,,,,,
10459914700,I would probably change my vacation week. I would rather go through the incovenience of changing my week than have to deal with a coworker that is unhappy with me. It's important to me that I have good relationships with my coworkers because it makes work so much more pleasant so I would just suck it up and change my vacation.,I would start my project and try and get as much of it done as I can. I would not wait until the last minute to get it done because there is a chance that I could get more last minute work. If I finish early than I can always double check it and make the project even better.,I would probably go. While I wouldn't be happy about going alone I think since one of our largest clients is there is would be important that I represent our company there. I would just make an appearance and stay for a short while.,I would schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss the feedback. I'd tell them that you are taking the feedback seriously and show them some evidence that you are actually doing better than they said. Hopefully they will see some of the positive you are doing ad maybe the consequences of the feedback can be lessened.,I would find this experience really positive. I really enjoy meeting people from different cultures and learning about different cultures. I think it would be fun to make some conections with people from a different country.,,,,,
10459900758,I would say that I am not willing to change my vacation plans either. I do not feel like it is my responsibility to change my plans. The boss should figure out a solution that works for all parties involved.,I would take my time on the project. I do not want to get last minute assignments that will take a lot of time. By dragging my feet I can hopefully prevent the supervisor from giving last-minute assignments.,I would not go to the meeting if my colleague did not go. I would ask my colleague to go with me first and try to convince them to go. If that did not work I would choose to skip it too. I don't see why I have to go if they are not going too. I have had a long day at work.,I would feel really frustrated about the situation. It could impact me financially which is not fair. I would ask to speak with the boss to review the feedback. I would gather proof beforehand to validate my point.,I would find this experience enjoyable because I like learning about new cultures. One of my favorite things to do is travel. If the project could also include travel I would be very interested. Either way it would be fun interacting with people from a different culture.,,,,,
10459700395,I would likely change my vacation plans.  I do not like confrontations with colleagues and if I could schedule my vacation for a different week to avoid confrontation then I would.  I also care about my fellow colleagues and want them to have an enjoyable experience with their family as well.,"I would work ahead on the project to ensure that I have everything complete by the due date.  I do not like procrastination and enjoy getting things done well before the due date to eliminate uncertainty.  Since, my work load is light I would prefer to make extra time in case my boss does give me unforeseen tasks at the last minute.","I would go to ensure that we keep a good relationship with our clients.  I am an introvert and do not enjoy networking and meetings however, if it is important to my job then I will leave my comfort zone.  I make decisions based on what I feel like I need to do for my job rather than basing my decisions on what my co-workers do.",I would work on the feedback that was given to me.  Just because I do not agree with it does not mean that I will not be graded on it in performance reviews.  I realize that I do not have perfect insight and sometimes others can see flaws in me that I am not able to see.  I would definitely want to work on it if I was risking my annual bonus.  I believe in putting pride aside and working to better myself in the eyes of others to perfect my flaws.,I would find this experience enjoyable.  I like learning about other peoples cultures and experiences.  I like seeing how other people see the world through a different filter than I do based on their cultural background and experiences.  I would find this task very enjoyable.,,,,,
10459720711,I would tell them that that is crazy. I will not be adjusting my life for them. I will not change mine either and im going on it too,I would have to talk to the boss because whats hes doing is lowkey remedial. Why would you keep giving me stuff close to this date. He needs to know whats up.,I would go anyways because I cant depend on anyone. I told myself this year im doing what i want to do so id go and mingle with people and meet who i needed to. i have no problem with doing things alone,I would talk to him. All these questions can pretty much be aswered with talk or communicate. I tell him thats not right. I show him its not right. Problem solved i think . He would see his error.,I would not do it because its not getting me any money. I would not waste time doing things like that when i can be painting and making money. I paint so it sounds  lot better than giving away my free time to my job with no pay. Thats like adult punishment.,,,,,

My coworker needs to change his/her plans.,"I would try to complete the project as soon as possible. Because I know of my boss' habit, I would not try to risk it. I would try to get everything done by the end of the first week.","I would go to the event for 1 hour. Because this is my largest client, I would not take the risk of not going. I need to make a presence, even if it's only for 1 hour.","I would ask for specific examples about the feedback. If the feedback seems legitimate, I would tell my boss that I will do whatever I can to improve. I would most definitely feel bad and a bit depressed about the feedback but motivated to do better.","I would find this experience very enjoyable. I love learning about new cultures and I would love the opportunity to travel there. You never know if somewhere down the line, there would be a need to travel there so I would definitely volunteer for that opportunity alone.",,,,,
10460073263,"I would suggest that the person who asked first should be given the time off on the week requested.  I believe that would be the only fair resolution to the situation if I we were both adamant in wanting the same time off.   If, however, my plans did not involve a need to be off on those specific dates - for some immovable event - then I might be willing to defer to my colleague, provided, of course, he wasn't being a jerk.  In cases of dealing with a jerk, I'd definitely hold to the ""first asked, first given"" scenario being the fairest plan.","I would work on the project as quickly as possible, completing the body of the work early.  Then, were my boss to assign additional work at the last minute, I would be able to accomplish that in addition to the original task.  If no additional work was given, I would be able to use the extra time to tweak or polish the project.","I would probably go to the event by myself.  I could put in an appearance and possibly take some benefit of the experience.  If there was no benefit to be had, I could look for the earliest opportunity to find an excuse to leave/sneak out.","I would feel extremely unsettled by this.  I would take a period of time to assess the feedback, determine why my manager might have made this wrong judgment concerning my performance.  Did he have all the information?  If not, I would try to find a way to give him the info in a non-defensive manner.","I would enjoy working on a project that requires me to learn new things and interact with people from places unlike those with which I am familiar.  It's always fascinating to find out about other cultures.  If travel were involved, that would be even better.",,,,,
10459680469,"I would talk to my supervisor about the situation. If I had reservations made for a special trip, I would insist that I couldn't just cancel my vacation. I would try to find out if my coworker had real plans or was just taking time off work. I would be pretty frustrated about the situation.",I would definitely start planning out a schedule for completing this project. I would begin working on it in order to complete it prior to the deadline. That way I would have everything under control and finished with time to spare.,"I would probably not go to the networking meeting. I would be too shy to go into a group of people whom I don't know. I would also feel that maybe the meeting wasn't that important if my colleague was thinking of not attending. If he/she did decide to attend, then I would definitely consider going also.","I would be very upset and anxious. I would also be frustrated that I was being given bad feedback that was inaccurate. I would definitely speak to my manager about the matter, and if it couldn't be resolved, I would likely speak to my manager's superior.",I would find this experience to be very interesting and enjoyable. Learning about the culture is the type of thing that intrigues me. I would probably volunteer for this project because Norway sounds like a very interesting topic.,,,,,
10460422212,"I would change my vacation plans. Odds are good that whatever I am planning to do for vacation is somewhat flexible, so changing shouldn't be too bad. I'd try to get my colleague and supervisor to acknowledge that I was making a sacrifice, to either get some positive regard or a returned favor at some point in the future.","I would work on the project as soon as I could. Getting the most important thing done when I have the resources to do it is important to me, and is conducive to the way I like to work. Knowing that there might be unpredictable conflicts toward the end of the time period just increases the importance of getting done early rather than trying to wait to the last minute.","I would not go if my colleague doesn't go. I find social gatherings to be difficult at the best of times and if I don't know anyone there that's a difficult situation. If I did go by myself there's a good chance I wouldn't have any good interactions anyway since I don't tend to be good in that sort of environment, so it's probably not a huge loss. If my colleague does go I might or might not go, it depends on how emotionally grounded I think I'd be able to be in the situation.","I would feel angry and annoyed, but powerless. Having people have wrong beliefs about me is extremely aggravating, but I rarely seem to be able to change anyone's opinions once they are set, so it's not clear that there's anything I could do. I would probably just stew in my negative emotions and face the consequences, and if the consequences of the mismatch are severe enough that I can't stomach working there anymore I'd start looking at other employment options.","I would find the experience enjoyable if someone else was guiding the process, such as giving a class or presentation or pointing out things to read, but aggravating and frustrating if it needed to be a more self-guided process because a vague goal like ""learn about a culture"" is something I always find aggravating and difficult to engage with and open-ended research on topics like ""the culture of Norway"" are tough because there's no way to determine what's too much and what's not enough, and it can be difficult to determine which sources to trust over others.",,,,,
10460225552,"I would ask my supervisor to research which of the 2 of us requested the time off first. Then, depending upon which of us made the request first, I would ask my supervisor to grant that person the time off. I feel that this is the only fair way to handle this situation.","I would definitely work as hard as I can to complete the project as least 5 days ahead of schedule. I dont like procrastinating and I also like to give myself time to make changes and evaluate my work.

Hopefully, having a mature and professional discourse, might sway my manager to change some of the feedback.",I would find this experience rewarding and enjoyable because I feel it is very interesting to learn about other cultures.

I would explain myself and why it was important to me to keep that week. If possible, I would change my week if I hadnt bought tickets, booked a room, etc.","I would spend the time now working on the project as much as possible, getting as far ahead as I could. This way if my boss were to give me additional work I would have the time to do both successfully. As I was getting closer to the due date I would make sure that I was talking to my boss about my progress and my case load to ensure they were aware of my ability to take on additional work.","I would still go to the meeting.

If I don't know anyone at the event that's okay, I can still take the time to go, be seen, and maybe meet some new people.",I would feel horrible about this situation and incredibly stressed. I would ask for a meeting with my manager to go over the feedback and discuss how I can strive to do better. I would talk to the boss about what they saw and how they determined the results. If I still disagreed I would go to their boss and request another review or an appeal of the review expressing my case.,"I would love this experience.

If I wasn't appreciated correctly for doing this or it continued to happen, I would simply take my vacation anyway and deal with the consequences.","I would work an hour extra each day to ensure I could finish the project well ahead of time. If my boss gives me last minute tasks a lot, it will almost certainly happen now. I will plan ahead and while working an extra hour would be rough, it's worth it to avoid looking bad at work.","I would try to convince my colleague to come, so I wouldn't be left alone. If they still wouldn't come, I would simply go alone. As awful as it would be, a large client is simply too important for nobody to show up for. I wouldn't be happy, but I'd do it.","I would follow the necessary protocols to ensure that my bonus wasn't deducted because of poor management. I would first try to explain to my manager that I thought he was wrong and this was going to effect my livelihood. If he wouldn't listen, I would go over his head to the next supervisor and explain the situation. If somehow that didn't work, I would file a formal grievance with HR to ensure my Bonus payment wouldn't be weak.","As someone with Norwegian ancestry, I would find it enjoyable.

I wouldn't raise a fuss under most any circumstances.",I would try to finish the project to the best of my ability and ahead of time. This way if something unexpected came up I would have time to address it. If nothing unexpected came up it would make me look good to have work done ahead of schedule. There wouldn't be much downside at all to this approach.,I would go to the networking meeting. I would remind myself that my own job performance shouldn't be dictated by the behavior of others.

Either way I would likely go to the networking meeting so that my boss wouldn't frown on me.,I would feel distressed.

If I was unable to resolve the issue to my satisfaction I would also question whether being in that job was worth it if unfair treatment was to be expected.,"I would probably volunteer to be involved on the project.

I may also speak with the boss to let him/her know how important this project is and what exactly I am up against in completing it on time.,I think this is potentially a good opportunity for me and the organization.  Despite not knowing anyone else at the event I think the advantage of going would outweigh any disadvantages.  I may also try to convince my colleague to reconsider going to the event.,I would request a meeting with my manager to express my views.  I would let the manager know why I felt the feedback was not true.  I would plead with him/her to reconsider the negative feedback based on my account of the situation.,Absolutely.

It would benefit the organization to have me there, while my colleague is gone.",I would get the entire project completed as quickly as possible. Because then I would have plenty of time to deal with my boss's last minute tasks. I would do this as a stress prevention measure. And also because it would mean my work was higher quality because I didn't wait till the last minute to do it.,I would definitely go. I would want to be there. I would want to take advantage of the networking opportunity. I would want to get to meet with one of our largest clients and get to know them and their needs better and just enjoy the networking opportunity.,I am pretty upset about this feedback. I would schedule a  meeting to discuss the matter further. I would gather conclusive proof that the opposite is true and present that at the meeting to clear things up.,I think this experience would be very enjoyable. I have traveled a lot and really enjoy learning about new places and people. I think it would be a lot of fun to learn more about Norway. I have friends in Norway already.,,,,,

There is no reason not to get started and I would want to take advantage of the slow time I have, especially knowing other tasks may come up last minute.","I would attend the networking event. If it's our largest client it would likely be important to be there and I would find people to talk to. Even if my colleague didn't go, I still would.","I would reflect on the feedback for a day and see how I feel about it tomorrow. If I still disagree with the feedback, I would set up time to meet with my manager to discuss in more detail and provide rationale and examples of why I disagree.","Yes, I would find that enjoyable. It would be interesting to learn about a different country and culture that I am not familiar with. Even without the travel, I would find an international project interesting.",,,,,

Otherwise it might not be fair.","I would finish the project ahead of time.  If my boss likes to add on things randomly, it would be best to prepare for this.  That way I'm not scrambling for time.",I would still go.  It expands my opportunities to advance at work.  I can socialize enough to make an impact and not have to worry about it beyond that.,"I would talk to my boss about it.  I would want to clarify the situation and explain why it's a mistake.  If my bonus is on the line, I'm not going to lose it due to an error.",I would find this experience enjoyable.  I enjoy learning about different countries and cultures.  It's fun to see how people live and the differences about them.  I could also use it as an opportunity to try new foods I've never had.,,,,,

If that fails I will embellish my story until they feel obligated to give me the desired vacation time.,I would handle the project as soon as possible. I like to complete things quickly. That way I will not have the stress of the pending due date.,I will try and convince them to go. Stating the fact that if they do not go I will have to go and not know anyone.,I would ask for the reasoning on the feedback. I would listen and then if I still do not agree.

Hoping that I had more seniority than the other person so I could get first choice. If I dont really need to have that specific week off, I dont mind changing my plans to help someone else out.","I would try to get the majority of the project done as soon as I could. I am not a last minute person anyhow, so I would want to get going right away. That way if my boss gives me a ton to do last minute, I will have gotten other stuff out of the way and hopefully have time to take care on the new work.","I would probably attend the event. I do not like this type of social gathering. Since this is a big client, however, I think I should at least put in an appearance. If things do not go well during the event, I would find a graceful way to go home.","I would be very unhappy with the feedback, and maybe a little angry. I would ask my manager for the rationale behind the feedback I received, and I would let them know that I do not agree with them and the reasons why.","I don""t really like to travel, so that aspect of not having to is fine with me.

I would not set myself up for failure by waiting until the last minute and then get bombarded with a bunch of last minute tasks.,I would suggest they go but it would not be a big deal if they didn't. I would use it as a networking opportunity and get to know various people in the room. The point is networking and meeting new people so it wouldn't be a big deal if they didn't come.,"I would feel as though I am being attacked. If my manager is wrong then his opinion will cost me money and that is no small thing. I would ask him for examples of my shortcomings, and if i can do better i would tell him that.",I would find it quite and enjoyable and I would want to travel. That would be nice to go to a place I have never been. And if the client is in Norway I could possibly work from home rather than going into the office everyday.,,,,,

I try to make my vacations flexible and not schedule things around the time when others are doing so. I might also ask If I could be payed double for having to sacrifice my vacation time that week. Aside from that, I probably would be rushing to schedule next year's vacation at an earlier time.","I would try to complete the assignments as quickly as possible in anticipation of the last minute assignments. It would be better for me to get them done before the boss drops a surprise visit. In addition, by being organized and being on time, I'm able to handle those tasks that might require lots of attention.","I would still go because meeting one of my largest clients could lead to new lucrative projects for the company. I think this potential project might get me a raise or even a promotion to another position.  Even though my colleague doesn't want to go, it still doesn't factor into my decision making.",I would feel very upset about this situation. I would probably set up a meeting with the boss to review the feedback and show them my progress on the project. I'd also secretly record things just in case of wrongful termination. In addition I might speak to a higher up about the situation and how unfair it is.,I think it would be interesting to learn about a new country and culture. I usually take the time to learn about different cultures from mine and even how to read the language if I do travel there. I think showing the client that you know or understand things about their culture could leave a lasting impression.,,,,,

10459711664,"I would go and talk to the colleague. It sounds as though the supervisor is leaving it up to us to work out. I would find out why he has to take that particular week and compare it to my plans. If one of us were actually flexible and just being stubborn, then we'd work toward trying to use that flexibility.  If both of us absolutely must have that week off (brother's wedding for example that can't be changed) then we'd try to figure out a plan to both take off.  See if other colleagues would be willing to work extra in exchange for us doing some coverage for them later - or something. Then take that proposal to the boss & explain why we really must have the time off, we're both exceptional workers, we've made these other accomodations, etc.","Unfortunately, I would plan on being proactive and getting it done early, but in reality I'm not very good on following through on those plans.  I would probably just chip away at the project like normal.

I would try to convince my colleague to accompany me, but even if that wasn't successful, I would go myself.  I think at least one of us should show up, plus, if networking is involved, I know it could be to my benefit, so I would just force myself to mingle and meet new people. However, I probably would also make sure I had an out and could leave early after making my dutiful appearance if it was just too painful.","I would feel bad and frustrated, of course. I wouldn't just slink away and lick my wounds, however. I would insist on talking at length about the issue to my manager to 1) understand why this feedback occurred. Is it his opinion? Did she hear something from someone else? Is there data to back this up? 2) then I'd try to find out how I can get rid of this negative impression. Even if I don't agree with it, there could be a kernel of truth or a perception that I need to address. I would want my manager to know my plan of correction to make sure this perception doesn't follow me into the future. If I have data to argue against the feedback, I'd certainly challenge it so it didn't affect my bonus.",I would love the experience of learning about a new culture. It would add some variety and interest to my job. I'd also be better suited to connect with that client or even to travel to Norway. I've traveled to Scandinavia for work in the past and it's been much more enjoyable that my typical business travel. Sounds like fun all around.,,,,,
10459685475,I would try to compromise with my colleague to see if perhaps we can share the same week by spliting it. For example she takes the first half of the week and i take the second half .

Also in doing this i hope to motivate my colleague in going since they will know that im tired too but going for such a short period of time.,"I would feel very anxious, bothered and upset, which leads to me not being able to focus at work. I would kindly ask my manager for some time after work where we can sit down and talk and discuss the situation. I would want to do it privately after work rather than when everyone is around and it gives me more time to reflect.","I would find this experience extremely enjoyable due to the fact i am a traveler.

By being finished with my initial project I could concentrate on the new work assignment.,I would still go to the meeting. Even though I don't know anyone yet it will be a great opportunity to network with new people.

I would try to show that I have been working hard and that the goals given to me in the past were taken seriously by me. I would try to show that I learn from my mistakes and grow from them.,I would find this enjoyable. I find other cultures very interesting. By becoming more educated in the culture of Norway I would also be a plus in dealing correctly with representatives from the company when they start contacting my company. Not all American customs are accepted by people in Norway.,,,,,

If no company policy exists, I would reschedule MY vacation if my colleague had seniority, if not, I would request my colleague reschedule theirs.","I would complete the project in a timely manner so that I only had to ""tweak"" it before the actual due date.

If my colleague refuses to go, I will go alone and make the best of it because I would want to please my client and take advantage of the opportunity to network as well.","I would be very upset.  Once I calmed down, I would respond in writing (in a timely manner) to the negative feedback with examples of why it isn't true/correct.

If it was I would talk with my colleague to see if maybe he or she would have a change of heart.,I would work on the project as much as I can in the 2 weeks before its due. As long as I do that I am sure I would be done with the project earlier than the due date. Just in case the boss was to give me any last minute tasks. To ensure I get all my work done on time.,I would go regardless of whether or not the colleague attends. It would look bad if I didn't go to a meeting that one of my largest clients invited me to. Networking meetings are always a good opportunity to meet new people and clients.,I would try to understand as best I could where my manager was coming from. I would ask questions to better understand where I went wrong. Then I would try to improve on whatever it was that I didn't do well. Negative feedback always makes me want to strive to do better.

For me this would be very upsetting and I would very anxious to resolve this issue.,I would find this project to be enjoyable.  It never hurts to broaden my horizon.

I have learned a two-pronged approach: I document everything I can numerically and subjectively (e.g., a testimonial or email citing good work); and I sometimes just go with the flow, not trying to disprove something if instead I can demonstrate progress elsewhere. That said, if this scenario happened I'd be plenty upset. Depending on the severity of the feedback, I would probably discuss it with out second in command and I might have to take it up with our board.

Also, I would kept the early completion of the project quiet. Further, I would clean up any loose ends and determine what tasks could be put off for a few weeks.

Would it be harmful to my health and social abilities if I was to go to the meeting after such a long day? Or would the benefits of the networking possibilities outweigh other negative consequences?,"I would feel rather upset about this feedback. My first action would be to reevaluate the work myself to see if in fact the feedback might be justified. If this is not the case, I would go and talk to my manager and see if I might not be able to improve the situation and the managers opinion of me.","I would find this experience enjoyable. In spite of not necessarily travelling, I am always open to learning more about other countries and their culture. As well, it would likely bring me more prestige in the company.",,,,,

If I find it unreasonable, I would go to my supervisor and ask them to randomly choose one of us to have the selected dates. I am willing to compromise or hear someone out, but if they are simply going to take a hard line with me for no good reason, then I will certainly take the same approach with them.","Attempt to get the project done early, so if there is an unexpected task that comes up I can still handle it and if there isn't one, I can have a more relaxed time at work for a bit. Since my workload is light leading up to the due date, this seems like a reasonable approach to take. One which accounts for everything.","It would depend on how badly I needed to network. If I am actively needing to network with these clients for one reason or another than I would suck it up and go by myself. If it isn't that important for me to network with them right then and there then I would wait for another opportunity to present itself (one that would be less socially awkward, preferably).","If my boss is treating me unfairly, to the point where it is reflecting poorly on me and costing me money, I would immediately start looking for other job opportunities. Life is too short to work for someone who is not going to be working for you in return. And working for someone that would endanger your career in such a way is just going to hurt you in the long run.","I would find such an experience interesting and enjoyable.

Networking is always a good idea in any field. It's smart to see who is working in your chosen field and analyze all possible options.,"I would listen attentively and respond accordingly.

Vacation is not important than my company.,I would always felt confidence in my ability to handle all the project in my company. Most of the time i would not lead my project to the last due time. I would always prefer to finish the work quickly. Using the best resources optimal would be my trick to handle the project.,I would go to the networking meeting.

The supervisor would see that I am agreeable.,Knowing my boss gives me other tasks on top of a project.  I would work on the project each day and not wait till the last minute.,I would go to the networking meeting.  It could help me in the future both personally and with the company.

I would hope my willingness to change would be remembered come evaluation time, though.","I would start on it immediately. I would try and complete it accurately, but in the fastest time possible.

But going to the meeting is at most important. As its the largest client of the company and it would not a good idea to deny meeting invitation from such a client. As it may lead to falls impression on the  client,I will really feel bad about the negative feedback and missing on bonus. But I will try to find out the reason why it has gone wrong. Also I will make sure that this will not happen again in the future. Also I will analyse what has gone wrong or any one has cheated on me. So as to take proper action.,"I would like to explore the opportunity. I would be keenly interested in learning new things, language, culture.

I'd do my best to assert myself and my right to a vacation.,I would do my best to get my current workload finished. Even though the current workload is light I want to be prepared. I would make sure everything is in order and consider past projects that are similar. I would do this to best mitigate the upcoming workload increase.,I would still go to the meeting. I feel that it would be very beneficial to my job standing. I don't mind being in situations where I don't know people. I would try to be personable and charismatic.,"I would feel upset about the situation. I would try and consider my boss's perspective on the matter.

I enjoy interacting with people from other cultures. I would use the experience to try and learn about another culture. I'd try and find some local places that display the American values well.,,,,,
10459680753,"I would ask the supervisor to use a method that randomly determines who gets the week off. For example, this method could be flipping a coin, using an online generator, or choosing a piece of paper out of a hat. Both of us would have to agree this arrangement and be present for deciding event. I choose this plan of action because I feel this method would be fair and unbiased in deciding who gets the week off.","I would complete my project as early as possible prior the 2-week deadline, but at the same time doing a good job. I don't want to the sacrifice of quality my work. Finishing my project early will allow me to deal with last minute tasks that may be time consuming. However, if a last minute task is not urgent, and I 'm still working on the task, I would also ask the boss if I could delay the task(s) until after the project deadline.","I would ask the colleague to do me a favor and go to this networking event with me. In return, I would offer to go to a different meeting or networking event with him/her in the future or cover dinner tonight. I also would explain the benefits of networking for him/her as well. If the colleague still decides not to go, I would go alone anyway to make connections, but it may not be as comfortable.","I would set up another meeting with the manager to discuss my concerns and disagreement with the feedback. However, I would be sure to not to verbally attack the manager, but instead provide evidence of previous work or feedback from clients/colleagues that argues against the negative feedback. If my manager brings up valid points, I will be open to his/her suggestions and feedback. Then, I would make a game plan with him/her to improve my performance in the future to demonstrate my proactive attitude and willingness to improve.","I would find this experience enjoyable because I like to learn about other cultures, perspectives, ways of living, and other countries.

10462913440,"I would first refer to the process to see if there was any prior occurrences of this issue. From there, I would speak to my supervisor directly to see if I had in fact requested the time off first. If I had requested the time off first, regardless of their wishes, I would let my supervisor know that I should be granted the right to keep my vacation.","I would start planning the project immediately. Because I know I have two weeks, it would be far better to enjoy my time at the end before the due date because I was not rushed. If I was able to finish in one week and there was no rush tasks given to me, I would have a week to catch up on less important tasks or enjoy the slowdown in pace.","Initially, I would speak with my colleague to see if there was a way that I could convince them to go. It would be far more preferable to have them join me at the networking meeting, than to be alone. If I was unable to, it still represents a great forced opportunity to be extroverted and build a network with my client that I would have otherwise not leveraged.","I would first take time to digest the information. Perhaps my manager was correct, but I need time to concentrate and do some self-reflection. Most importantly, after the period of self-reflection you could discuss with the manager the feedback and present yourself in a positive light as someone who can digest the feedback and adjust your behaviors to be a better employee going forward.","I would find the experience both enjoyable and boring.

I would want to take full advantage of having a light work load and get this out of the way. This would ensure I would have time to complete any additional assignments.,I would go to the event. This would be a great opportunity to network even if I did not know anyone. I am sure I would meet some friendly faces and make some connections while in attendance anyway.,"I would listen to what is said and take it in. Perhaps there was a mixup. It's not worth getting heated right away. If it really was untrue, I would contact HR.","I would volunteer because I think I could learn from this experience.

That way I had time to review and make final changes if time permitted. And if other things came up, I wouldn't be stressed out",I would go since it would look good for me to be there.

My husbands family is from Norway and I think he would enjoy me learning and letting him know as well. there is so much to learn in this world,,,,,
10459660935,I would go out of my way to try and reason with them. Maybe ask them if they can cut half of their week and change those days to another week. If they still said no I would do what I can to try and explain to them that they have to be willing to make a compromise sometimes and they are not the only ones with vacation plans. If they still are being stubborn I would remind them of their stubborness and proceed to change my vacation but make it known if this happens again I would be unwilling to ever again change my dates.I would be willing to change my vacation once to show I am not going to be unreasonable. However I would not let it happen again so they know they cannot take advantage of me.,I would while my work load is pretty light get as much done of the project as possible.

Get as much done as i can in case my boss did give me another task. I would try to finish it as soon as possible.,I would go to the networking event. While it is uncomfortable not knowing anyone it usually works out for the best. Being alone pushes you to talk to new people instead of staying in your friend group.,I would talk to my manager. Try to find where the disagreement is and work it is. It could be just a misunderstanding.,"I would find this experience enjoyable. I love to learn and experience new things. While it might not require travel, it could inspire me to travel Norway and experience the culture first hand.",,,,,
10440206991,I would change my vacation week as long as I could rearrange any plans I had during that week. I would be flexible because it would show positive qualities to my supervisor and my colleague would owe me a favor later. I would be annoyed with my colleague but would be the bigger person.,I would plan out a schedule for working on the task that would allow me extra time before it was due in case I had other responsibilities pop up. I would pace myself and hold myself accountable for getting a certain amount of work done each day. I would also regularly check in with my boss to see if they had more work for me so I would not be surprised.,I would beg them to go with me so that I was not alone.

I would thank them so much for going with me when they said yes so they knew how much I appreciated it.,I would definitely raise my concerns with my supervisor. I would be frustrated but would concentrate hard on remaining calm and professional while discussing it. I would not walk away from the conversation without expressing my feelings and making sure I was heard by my supervisor.,I would fine this experience enjoyable.

10462917164,"I would talk to my colleague first and ask them what their plans are, to see if their vacation is easier to reschedule then mine and try to work it out with them. If that doesn't work, as in they are being difficult, I would go to my supervisor next to discuss it. I would probably ask them who requested the time first and who they feel is most needed during the requested time. If both my colleague and my supervisor feel I should be the one to change my vacation time because it isn't that bug of an issue for me and I don't want to leave my work short staffed.",I would continue with my project as planned. Since I am used to these last minute tasks I leave tine for changes. If I feel the project is good as is or that the talks just can't be done in the time i have left I would ask for help with smaller tasks in order to lighten my load and help me finish the project. After I would have a talk with my boss about better communication.,I would still go to the meeting. It is a good opportunity to meet new clients and I don't want to look bad in front of my current client. I might feel uncomfortable but the point of the meeting is to make new connections.,I would feel really frustrated and down on myself because I am confident about my work and I don't understand why I am getting this kind of feedback. Losing my bonus would be a big blow but I need to know what is behind the feedback. Are they seeing something I'm not? Is this just workplace discrimination? I would confront my manager and ask for a breakdown of their thoughts on the subject.,"I would find this experience very enjoyable. I am fascinated by the way people all around the world live. Learning about a people's culture, their history, or their language is a beautiful thing and I would love to have a chance at it.",,,,,

If I were able to change my plans, I would be happy to let my co-worker go on his/her vacation and take mine another time.","I would start the project early. I would try to get it done before the due date. Once the project was done, I would be able to handle any last minute tasks from my boss with any time remaining.","I would go to the networking meeting.

I would want a chance to defend myself and possible change his mind. I would present relevant facts about my work during the meeting.,I would find this experience enjoyable. I would like the opportunity to learn something new about a different country. I think that volunteering might also be good for my career because it would be good experience.,,,,,
10459979648,I would go ahead and let them have that week and find a different week to do my own vacation. The reason is there is plenty of weeks in a year and if they happened to forecast it first then they deserve it. Which it is impossible we had both forecasted the same day. I would rather leave things less stressful between me and my co-worker and instead pick a different week even if it is the following week.,I would handle this situation immediately. If my current workload is light leading up to the due-date I might as well handle the project right now just in case my boss does give me a last minute task that could take up more time to which I would be incapable of completing my original task.,I would completely go to this networking party for many reasons despite not having my co-worker there. #1 I would go because it could potentially be good for my career. Everyone knows networking is everything in business. #2 I would go because I could find out more about my current client that could be a potential usable commodity in the future. #3 It could maybe even be fun and I don't need a friend as a babysitter to make me feel better.,"I would feel dis-heartened about the negative feedback. I would feel frustrated. I would ask my manager how to come up with the most logical way to fix this scenario and attempt to fix it any way I could. I would appreciate the constructive criticism however, I would also remain to hold my tongue at bay until I figured out what I truly did wrong in their eyes despite my own opinion.

Culture is an interesting aspect to any country/ continent that I would love to work and learn in that situation.,,,,,

As long as it was a leisure vacation and not something else scheduled timing is unimportant.,I would make every effort to complete the project early. If there is extra time that can be used to review and refine. If the boss adds work late it won't be detrimental to the project.,I would attend the event. Not knowing anyone is not a good enough reason to skip and miss the potential new business/opportunities. The whole point of a networking event is to meet people anyway. If everybody already knew everyone else why have the event?,"I would take some time to review the feedback and any related documents, reports, notes, etc. I would then compare that with my own understanding. If after review I felt I still had a valid argument I would ask to meet with the boss to review my position and discuss why that differs from his and how to remedy it either now, or for the next time.","I would find the experience enjoyable. It's always good to learn new things - be it trivia or more practical information. The experience may introduce customs or practices that prove beneficial either directly or indirectly, in business or otherwise. Showing initiative and willingness to adapt to the job at hand may benefit future job aspirations.",,,,,
10440153356,"I would just sit and talk with my co worker and see if we could come to a compromise. I would assume we are both making plans for that week, so if we could split the week up that may be perfect. Either way, I would be willing to come to some sort of an agreement to make things work.","I would just make it very clear to my boss that I need to know all aspects of the project to be sure I meet the deadline. I would not want to get bombarded with tasks towards the end, so to ensure I was able to schedule accordingly, I would be very black and white with him/her. I would also make sure to communicate with them day to day to be sure we were on the same page with what I was doing.","I would plan on going either way most likely. I would tell them that I would feel like I was missing an opportunity if I did not go, and tell my friend that Ill be there so it may be easier for you to just walk with me. Either way, I would not put to much pressure on them.","I would probably try to sit down and talk with them.I would make sure to not come across as confrontational, but instead really just find out how I could improve. I would tell them that my intentions were to work the best I could, and if I did that bad then I must need to reevaluate my goals.","I would find the experience very enjoyable.

I would find it interesting and enjoyable. This is because I am always interested in learning about new people and places.,,,,,
10459659684,I would probably try to discuss the situation with my coworker a little bit more. I don't think it is mature that my coworker is not willing to swap with me. Both sides of the story need to be taken into consideration.,"I would get started on the project right then and there. To me, it is not worth it to stress out due to my procrastination. I may not finish the whole project in one sitting, but I would work on it so I didn't feel as stressed.","I would still go out. I am a fairly sociable person, so I would't have a problem going in alone. I would probably talk to my coworker about joining me, but it wouldn't be an issue if he or she didn't.",I would have a mature conversation with my manager. I would definitely stand my ground.

By working on the project bit by bit rather than leaving it to the last minute leaves enough time and attention for the things that may come at you in the next two weeks.,I would still attend the networking party. It would be one of my largest clients and I wouldn't miss that opportunity. I don't think my colleague not going would change my mind because I would be to busy talking and chatting up as many people in the room as I could.,I would have a longer conversation with my manager getting feedback on exactly what went wrong and how I could improve. I would also ask for a second opinion if there was another manager. I think it would be important to do everything possible to correct the situation and make sure that bonus stays locked in.,I would still find this task pretty enjoyable. I love learning about new things and different people or places so it would not be boring at all. I feel like a trip would be beneficial to collecting this info but not necessary. There are plenty of sources to collect this information online.,,,,,
10440129498,I would work with the colleague and do what I could to move my vacation. I may ask my colleague for some help in the future though for this flexibility on my end now. I think this is reasonable.,I would work hard on the project right away. I do not like to procrastinate and would want to make sure I had this done quickly. This would allow me to take on other tasks if they were to come up.,"I would go to this meeting and would be excited to have this opportunity to present. I know that I would be tired and ready to rest, but this is an important opportunity. I would not let this pass.",I would be upset but would want to work with my manager to figure out what to do to make things right.

For me, this would not be boring but instead would be very exciting.",,,,,

I would also tell them that this vacation has been planned for a long time and I cannot change the dates otherwise I would have to pay change fees.,I would start the project right away so I could get it over with early even though I am confident in my ability to finish it quick. I would rather get it out of the way just in case my boss gives me a last minute task because I would not want to be rushing to finish everything. I like to start tasks early and get as much off of my plate as possible so I am less stressed in the end.,I would not go because I would want to stick with what my colleague does. I do not like going into situations where I don't know anyone so I would not feel comfortable there without my colleague.

I would also think that this experience would prove myself as a worker and that I am willing to take risks.,,,,,

If I have non refundable reservations or something like that, then I would have to explain that and see if we could find a different solution.","I would try to begin working on the task daily in small amounts.  Especially when my other workload is light, I'd probably designate a time daily to put towards the project.  I expect I would set aside time each afternoon because I like to get a cup of coffee at that time and work on ongoing things.  This is my usual habit.","I would not be eager to go.  I don't enjoy networking in the first place, and if my colleague werent there it would be even worse.  Sometimes I talk myself into going despite my reluctance, but my desire most assuredly would be not to go.","I would feel indignant.  I would feel put upon and angry.  Most likely, I would talk about it with other co workers and with my spouse.  But I am not sure if I would bring it up with the manager.  Maybe i would do so in a round about way.","I would find it interesting, even more so if I would get a chance to travel.  I like learning about other cultures and ways of doing things.  I already often take the chance to learn about these things when I have the opportunity.  Definitely I'd find this project enjoyable.",,,,,

I would then tell them my plans and when I put in for it. If they put in for the vacation before me I would just own up to it and let them have it. However, if I had put the request in before them I would let them know my full intention for taking the vacation. Alternatively, if no one had yet put in for the vacation I would suggest we flip for it and leave the results to chance.","In a project like this I would be sure to manage my time and tasks accordingly. I would anticipate my boss dropping more work on me later in the projects life cycle. Therefore, I would be sure to stay in touch with my boss and keep an open line of communication. This would allow me to find out any additional tasks ahead of time and potentially anticipate any problems, so that I can prepare.","In this situation I would ask my colleague why they could not attend. I would then prepare to go it alone. This meeting is very important and I do not plan to miss it just because I have to go alone. I would instead go and make the best of the situation.

If there was no clear resolution, I would either offer to split the week somehow (co-worker takes end of previous week and beginning of week in question) so that we could both be accommodated.","I would get as much of the project done in advance as possible. I would take advantage of having a light workload to get ahead of schedule. That way I would ideally be ready with the project, plus have time to complete any other tasks assigned by my boss.","I would go to the networking meeting.

It would be something well outside the norm of my job, and be enriching to engage with a new culture and country. I would love to volunteer to show my interest and willingness to take on new projects.",,,,,
10432532568,I would ask my supervisor who put the request in first.  I think whoever requested the time off first should have first pick.  I would see if my supervisor would do it that way since it would seem more fair.,I would take advantage of my workload being light.  I would finish the project at my earliest possible time in order to be ready in case my boss gives me something else to do that needs to be finished.  I think this is the best way to handle this.,"I would try to convince my coworker to go with me for a limited amount of time.  If the coworker doesn't agree, then I would have to go alone.

In addition, it there is not a strong reason why I cannot change my plans then I would be willing to do so if necessary.","I would put the project into my schedule, blocking out the necessary time required.

If both of us had planned a long trip with air, hotels etc. Then I would expect my boss to let us both go because there's no such thing as the indispensable man.","I would accelerate my time frame so that I got the project done early, that way I would have time to devote to working in any last minute details. I would also have a deep discussion with my boss if this was a recurring problem. If he is that unorganized he shouldn't be in charge.","I would go to the meeting. I am a grown boy and don't need someone to hold my hand in strange places. Besides it is my client and I should have the drive to go and do all I could to help. That is common in work places where someone, especially in a different time zone, assumes that you are available anytime they want to talk to you. If you expect to be competent at your task then you have to be ready to stretch yourself.",I would feel aghast that someone would question my work and I would wonder what they found to be objectionable.
