I would first consider the reason in requesting the time off.  Is the week requested just a week I'd like to have, or something more important such as a wedding in the family, etc.  I would have a conversation with my colleague about why the specific dates were requested.  Then possibly review who put the request in first.
I would try to reason with him, and then probably punch him in the face, cause im sick of him doing that stuff to me. He's usually a jerk to me at work and constantly harassing me to do his job while hes lazy. But I would end up being the bigger man and just change mine.
I would just let my coworker has the vacation time since they are not willing to change their plans. I figure that willing giving up my time would look good in my bosses eyes and they will think about me more when its time for a promotion.
I would probably cancel my plans. Someone has to give way, and the other person was not willing to do so. I would not want to deal with the hassle of trying to push the other person into a different decision. I would feel resentful toward them in the future.
I would first try to convince my colleague to change his or her mind about the vacation. What I would do if my colleague would not relent depends on whether or not I am senior to my colleague. If am senior to my colleague, I would request management forcibly deny his or her vacation request. If I am junior to the colleague, I would reschedule my vacation.
I would just choose to take my vacation another time.  It would not be worth the hassle to try and convince my colleague.  I would just let them have the vacation time.
I would "graciously" give up my vacation time. My vacation isn't worth more than looking like a team player. At least not to me personally. If I have a vacation I can't easily replace in time such as visiting a favorite aunt before she croaks then I will explain why it is important and hold my ground. If I am told to give it up by higher authority at that point then I will be serious and let it show that something else must be given for me to concede...maybe more time off or lesser duties so I can tend to what I needed the vacation time for from afar.
I would probably agree to go at a different time. I am an "empty nester" at this point, so I don't have to worry about kids, etc. So, my vacation plans are variable.
I would let my colleague take his vacation first and then would choose a different week. I then would hope that the manager would notice the fact that I am more flexible. Besides I would not be bothered to delay my vacation while I would be helpful at work.
The answer to this question depends upon what I had planned for that particular week.  In most cases, I would simply change my plans.  If my plans also included many other people who had made plans for that same event I would argue my case with my boss and allow my co-worker to do the same. Then my employer could make and informed decision about that week of vacation.
I would change my vacation plans. Most often, having this argument simply isnt worth the time and effort involved and would likely just stress me out. I also don't want to negatively impact my reputation with my colleague when I may have to work with them in the future.
I would come to work. I would not be pleased but I would understand. Next time I wished to go on vacation I would ensure that I requested the time off far in advance and get my supervisor to agree.
I would probably rearrange my schedule and go at a different time. I am usually flexible and unless it was an emergency situation it would be no big deal. I don't sweat the small stuff and save confrontation for when it is really important.
I would try to change my time if it was not something absolutely non refundable such as a plane ticket.  If it was something I could not move around, it would seem that the  coworker with more seniority should receive the time off.  I would suggest the supervisor take into account seniority as well as how long the request had been in.
I would talk to my colleague and see if there was a compromise we could come to. Then, if they still would not change anything I would end up trying to reschedule my own vacation. I would want to be the bigger person and seem versatile to my boss by changing my vacation.
If my colleague had a family and couldn't change their plans and I could, I'd switch my weeks. If I couldn't change, I'd talk to my supervisor for a solution.
I would most likely take the alternate week, because it's still vacation and I am usually more flexible than others
I would not be willing to change my vacation plans either. I would ask another colleague to work my shift so that it would be covered. I don’t think it is fair that I’d have to change my plans because my colleague scheduled their vacation plans the same time as me.
I would just go along to get along and reschedule my vacation on a different week. To me it wouldn't be a big deal and to avoid conflict with my employer and fellow employee I would change the date. I would talk to my boss and explain to him it's alright and that I will work the week my other colleague is away on vacation. Plus it'd probably make me look like a better employee than arguing about it.
NOT CHANGE MY PLANS MAKE MY SUPERVISOR FIGURE IT OUT NOT FAIR TO MAKE ONE OF US CHANGE WHEN WE WORK VERY HARD
I would demand that who ever has more senority get the desired week off. it does not matter who wins in the end, as long as it is fair. And nothing is more fair than getting something extra over someone else because you have devoted more time to the company.
I WOULD TAKE IN TO CONSIDERATIONWHO HAS THE MOST SENORITY.  I KNOW THAT I WAS NEXT TO LAST THAT WAS HIRED.  THEREFORE MY COLLEAGUE WOULD BE WITH IN THEIR RIGHT TO TAKE VACATION TIME BEFORE ME.
I would make my plans for a different time. I would try and make sure that I could do what I wanted to a different time. I need to make sure that there is a good teamwork vibe at work.
I would agree to take a different week off if the coworker was willing to make a gesture to me. I would suggest exchanging a certain number of off days or to cover tasks at work for a short time. If the coworker was unwilling to do so I'd argue to the supervisor or HR that the person with seniority should get preferred vacation time. I don't see why I should automatically agree to change my plans based on the information given.
I would first consider what extenuating circumstances might be leading my colleague to be so inflexible. I would then consider whether I am able to be flexible. If I am able to be flexible, then I would change my plans, but I might hold a bit of a grudge against the colleague. If I am not able to be flexible, I would ask to speak to my colleague about it to see if we could negotiate something. If we could not negotiate, I would ask my supervisor to consider being flexible. Perhaps we could each agree to monitor email or participate in calls remotely.
I would ask the supervisor, first of all, if he could allow me to take my vacation anyhow.  If he said it wasn't possible I would change my plans and work it out for another time.
I would change my vacation plans.  I would be positive.  I would hope for the best.
I would go to the supervisor and tell him that it should go on seniority. Whichever empolyee that hired out first should get the week. The reason why i would do this is because its the only fair way. And hopefully the supervisor would be commendable to it.
I would offer to let the colleague take the vacation time off now.  In return, I would ask that my request for time off around the Christmas holidays take priority over any other request.  That seems like a fair trade-off.
I would take the week my colleague didn't want to take.  I would expect the same treatment when/if vice versa next time the same situation would come up.
I would ask my supervisor if there was any flexibility. I would also check to see which one of us asked for the time off first. If I asked after my coworker, I would allow the coworker to have the time off, but I would be reluctant to accommodate the coworker if I had been the first to request leave.
I would explain to this colleague that my vacation time is dependent on my husband's availability with his job in the military and we don't have any wiggle room. I would ask for the colleague to reconsider. If this colleague is still unwilling to change, I would explain the same with our supervisor and then have the supervisor make the final call. I feel that there needs to be some sway when it comes to military families due to the sacrifice our families make.
I would talk to my colleague and see if they are willing to change their week. I would also try to find out which of us requested the time off first - whoever asked for it first should get it. I would probably end up just not taking that week off and requesting the week right after it.
I would tell my manager to decide. There is no reason why I should allow my colleague to get their way. There needs to be a fair way to determine who gets vacation.
I would let them take the week off for vacation. I can use this to my advantage in the future in case I really need to get off for vacation, as I could say I did you favor before. I'm generally a pretty easy going and adaptable guy, I could make this situation work well I think.
I WOULD CHANGE MY VACATION TO OTHER WEEK. IT IS BEST TO BE IN PEACE WITH MY CO-WORKER. I CONSIDER THIS SITUATION VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
I would ask my Supervisor who requested the vacation time 1st. If it was my colleague, I'd back out because it's only fair. However, if it was me who requested the time off 1st I'd ask my Supervisor to consider that fact in making his decision.
I would see if I could reschedule my vacation. If I could with little negative effect to me, I would just do that and compromise. If my plans were all pre-set and nonrefundable, I would appeal to my supervisor about all of my investments in my vacation and see which vacation is more of a loss if that week gets canceled for one of us.
If I had a good working relationship and respect for this colleague, I would attempt to accommodate their requests. If I did not have their respect, I would attempt to negotiate with my colleague. I would attempt to obtain a preferred work assignment or opportunity in exchange for my flexibility of changing my and my family's vacation. If the colleague is not willing, I would request my supervisor decide on who gets the week off.
That would depend on whether I had already booked plans.  If I hadn't then I would change my week to not cause trouble.  If I already had booked my travel plans I would go to the supervisor and tell him/her that they had to decide because we both have plans.
I would first try to find out who requested that week first. I think that whoever requested it first should get it. However, if I don't have anything booked or my plans are flexible I would just let my colleague have that week.
I would first try and see who put in for it first. If we both put it in at the same time then I would try and talk to my boss and whoever had seniority should get it off. If the boss wont do that, then i guess I would have to change my vacation date.
I would change my week of vacation because I dont want to cause any problems to the company, and also I dont want to be in bad terms with my coworker, so I think that is the main reason to change my vacation time
I would be upset and probably hold a grudge against him or her. I may try to bribe him or her with some sort of incentive if there is no compromise. If that plan fails I would be very angry and it would become difficult to work together. I would simply have to change my vacation days because there is no getting around it.
I would probably just change my plans. Vacations can be taken almost anytime. Rather than upset the apple cart, I would prefer to keep peace in the workplace.
I would ask my colleague if they have plans that can be changed without penalty.  If so, I would try to convince them to take a different week.  I would tell them that I'd be willing to help them out with their workload in exchange.
I would examine my vacation plans and see if I could change them. If not, I would meet with my colleague alone and discuss the situation to see if we can figure out some compromise. Perhaps we could move the dates of our vacations a bit to reduce the overlap, or maybe my colleague isn't as firm on those dates as it appears.  After that I'd request a meeting with my colleague and my supervisor to settle on a fair course of action that meets at least most of our goals. This would be the fairest way to do it.
It depends on who requested it first.  If It was me I would be vehement in going on my vacation and making my co-worker stay behind.  If he went first, then I would probably concede since I view it as a first come first serve.
I would choose a different date as I don't have the tolerance to go back and forth with my colleague about this. However going forward I would definitely keep this in mind, because I'm pretty sure a time will arise where the colleague will need my assistance of some sort. A forgive but most definitely not forgetting situation.
I would most likely change my plans if that were possible to make it easier on the rest of my colleagues. If I couldn't easily change my plans either, I'd suggest some sort of selection game or process such as picking a number or doing rock,paper, scissors to figure out which one of us should get that week of vacation.
I would first see how important this vacation date is to me. If it is not that important, then I would happily just choose another date. However, if the date is important to me, then I would tell the supervisor to decide himself because I cannot change dates.
I would not budge and attempt to get my requested vacation. I would state that I have already made the plans and cannot change them, and explain why I deserve that week of instead of the other person. If I performed better than them, I would definitely bring that up to further plead my case. If the employer won't budge, I'd offer to work remotely from the location a few days if the other person would agree to do the other days.
I would change my plans just to have a good image and show I can be nice. I don't mind changing my plans since I always do it. Maybe I would ask for a vacation the week after.
I would look at my plans and if possible "take one for the team" and change my vacation plans. I feel like this would not be a huge deal unless hotel reservations can't be changed or airline tickets can't be refunded. If at all possible, you should try and keep harmony at your work place.
I would ask them what is so pressing about their plans. Depending on their answer, I would decide whether to bargain with them or absolute refuse. Most likely, I would try to offer them the vacation time they want in exchange for some money or other incentive.
I would go ahead and change my plans.  I would want to help the company.  It may also show the boss I am dedicated to the job.
I personally would let him have the time.  Granted I hadn't paid for a vacation; plane fare, hotel etc.  If I did, I'd have to argue the fact with him.  Otherwise, I'd let him have the week off. If he's unwilling to change his plans he's probably a real sweetheart to work with. Not.
Unless my plans were urgent or time sensitive, I would probably be willing to change the week of my vacation. I would speak with my colleague and try to find out why he or she is so unwilling to change. If their plans are more urgent or time sensitive than mine, I'd agree that they should take that week off. If mine plans were more important, I'd try to convince my colleague to change his/her mind.
I usually ask for vacation well ahead of time, so I would probably be okay with changing. As long as I did not have some specific reason for those dates, I would not be too upset probably. I would think whoever asked first should get it.
I would begin to look for alternative dates for my vacation. If I had higher seniority than my co-worker I would present this to my supervisor to get the preferred week off. If this was not the case, I'd just have to change my plans.
I would consider my colleague's wishes and try my best to reschedule my vacation. I would be upset but still try to be the bigger person.
I would ask whether there were alternate arrangements that could be made so that we could both take vacation at the same time, such as completing some work ahead of time or rescheduling projects.  I would also check to see which of the two of us asked first.  I would check with the colleague as to why they can't reschedule, and if it's a good reason, I would change my vacation request.
I would try to explain the nature of my vacation. If I had ordered tickets already, I may have to have continued discussion with my boss. It is possible that I could work out some sort of deal regarding trading current vacation days for additional days in the future. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to contact the HR department.
I would take a different vacation week.  This is because I would not want to cause a problem at work.  It's not worth causing the conflict.  This would also maybe make them offer a favor to me.
I would be happy to change my plans. While it might not be convenient, it isn't really a big deal, and my turn will come around again in the future. I'd be happy to switch weeks.
I would determine who had the vacation on the books first. If I had it first, I would take my vacation when I wanted to, however if the colleague had their vacation on the books first, I would allow them to take it. It highly depends on my relationship with the colleague and who had the projected vacation first.
My actions would be dependant on my vacation plans. If these were non-refundable, important and planned way-in-advance arrangements, I would find a way to negotiate with my colleague(s). Is there anything I can offer him to have him work with me? Could my other colleagues be talked into picking up extra hours that work? If my plans weren't already set, then I'd make a show of taking one for the team and make sure my colleague knew that I was making a "sacrifice" for him.
I would ask my coworker why they would not change their plans.  After that I would try to figure out some sort of compromise.  Perhaps one of us could have this vacation time and next time the other would get the vacation time.  If we could not reach an agreement, I would ask my boss to step in.
I would change mine if I could. If I couldn't, I would explain that to them, and hope that they would be more flexible. I would try to talk to them and find a solution.
I would find out how this was handled in the past.  I would then find out if I had placed my request for vacation first.  Upon getting that information I would then talk to my supervisor stating that I placed my request first and it should be honored.
I would not have a choice but to change my vacation plans. Hopefully I have not already paid deposits or made plans that cannot be changed. If I had and there was no way to adjust my vacation, I would find out which one of us technically requested the week off first. Whoever did should receive the week.
I would oblige to working the same week we both requested off. Thinking ahead, I could probably find an even better time to take my vacation. Also, this would gain positive attention from the boss.
I would allow him to take the vacation and Marc it down. Next time when I need I will take vacation. This way I can show some empathy to the other person and also become trusted by supervisor.
i would just wait for another week to take my vacation i would try not to make a big deal about it and i may look as someone who doesnt create problems in front of the supervisor or boss
i would change my plans so my colleague could go but as a trade off, if it happens again in the future then my colleague would have to change their plans and stay. They may have a good reason why they won't change their plans. I will be flexible this time as I like to be a team player and be supported of my fellow co workers.
I will try to talk to the co-worker. I would try to reason with them. Hopefully with the intent to come to a compromise. I would also consider altering my schedule. And potentially shaming the other co-worker.
I would alter my plans to ensure I could vacation during the holidays since this is the only time I take a really long vacation. If it was during the holidays I would shift my vacation a few days left or right but still take the same amount of time. If nothing else worked, I would volunteer to telework on my vacation.
I would talk to the coworker and see if there is any flexibility since I have family plans.  If the coworker does too, I would like need to change my plans for another week.
I would take a different week. I do not mind as long as I get time off. I think our time is better used on work instead of further discussing this.
I would select another week for vacation. I want to keep in good standing with my supervisor and my coworkers.
I would talk to the other employee and let him know that I also value that week for vacation. I would expect that he would explain why it is important to him. If he does so, i would probably back down and let the supervisor know that I'm willing to change plans to help the company.
I would try and work it out with the colleague. If that failed, I would attempt to change my own plans. I would be willing to change mine in order to keep workplace harmony.
I would determine who put in for the vacation first. If I requested off first, I would stick to my guns and refuse to change my vacation. If the other person requested first, i would schedule my vacation another week.
To avoid a bad stressful situation at work like a lot of tension with my colleague over who will take vacation one week over another. And avoid creating a bad work environment. I have no choice but to let my colleague have their vacation time and wait.
I would try and compromise if possible. If the co worker was refusing to compromise, I would compare our plans for vacation together and see who has easier to cancel plans. If my plans were easier to cancel, I would cancel them first.
I would take my vacation. I planned it and vacations are meant for relaxing. I would not sacrifice my vacation week for my colleague.
I would probably just have to suck this one up.  Not real sure here.  If my colleague is unwilling to change their vacation plans, then it appears I a\m backed in a corner to where I would be expected to change mine.  At this point I am not happy.  But nothing else I can do.
I would just change my plans. I am not picky. If it was a specific event, I would try to negotiate or even do something for them to make up for it.
I would expect my supervisor to make the decision regarding which of us would be able to take the requested vacation time.  In fairness, I feel whomever submitted the request first should be granted the time.  If I had already made any financial commitments related to the vacation time (for example, placing a non-refundable deposit on a hotel room), I would definitely hope I would be granted the time and would stick up for myself.  If my colleague had requested the time before me, I would be disappointed and sulk but would understand that my colleague should be granted the time in that case.
I would clearly asked for the days off first. I will go talk to my manager to express this. There are protocols to follow and since I asked first that means the days I requested are of top priority so I shouldn't lose my days
I would compromise by making sure the next time I would vacation, my colleague must work for me.  I feel this way because it's about fairness, even though at this time, my colleague wasn't willing to change plans.  I don't feel the matter is serious enough to cause any kind of personal issue to the colleague for his action.
i would change the week of my vacation. I rarely had a time sensitive vacation. I also would always schedule for the slowest time of the year.
I would probably just work the schedule as normal.  I would definitely use this though for my next pay raise and make sure my boss knows that I gave up my vacation time to accommodate a co-worker.  I would not be angry towards my co-worker, even though inside I would feel anger towards him/her.
I would consider the situation as one that I can show maturity and depth. I would tell my boss that I will change my vacation week to a different week. I would explain to the boss that I recognize that responsibility is a big part of any job and to show my responsibility to the job I have I would be willing to change the vacation dates I was going to take.
I would do my best to talk to my family members and try to change our plans. I would also see if there is a compromise that could be made. Perhaps my coworker could the beginning of that week and I could take the end of that week.
I would discuss it with my supervisor further. I would ask who requested it first. Then I would ask who had more seniority in the company. I don't think it's fair that I would have to change mine just because the other person doesn't want to.
Well I'm not willing to change my plans either. I wanted this vacation and if it's for a week that means I probably made reservations to leave the country. Also, based off of the passage, it appears that I could have requested it first. Either way, I'm simply not going to show up during that week, so what happens happens.
I would allow my colleague to the week's vacation.  However, since I am giving in and allowing them to have the week, I would request an extra few days of vacation to be used at another time.  I would point out that I am being flexible and try to use that to my advantage.
I would try to make plans for another week.  I would avoid confrontation.  I would try to work out the problem to see if we can make it work.
I personally would switch with my colleague as I never usually go on expensive trips, etc. Almost always, it would be something local if I were in this situation and therefore I could switch without too much hassle.
If I had requested my vacation first I would push back a little bit to try to get them to switch. Otherwise I would try to see if we could compromise and each have half of the week off as originally planned and take before or after off. I would not be happy if I had to completely reschedule but I probably would to keep a job.
I would change my vacation if I didn't have any plans.  If I had plans I would go ask my manager to approve and tell him I already have paid for certain things and can not get a refund.  I would do this because it is true.
I would talk to the colleague to make my own assessment of how time-sensitive his plans are.  If his/her plans are pretty tied to that week but my plans are not, I would strongly consider asking for a different week. If my plans are more dependent on that week that the colleague's, I would continue negotiating with the colleague to see if I could convince him or her to change. If I was unable to negotiate an appropriate outcome I would ask the supervisor to help mediate a solution.
I would ask my colleague to reconsider their choice because I would want to go on my vacation. But if my colleague is still being difficult, I would just change my week to another week. It wouldn't be deal to me because I wouldn't want to damper my vacation mindset with drama  of work.
I would change my plans. I wouldn't think highly of my colleague because of how selfish they responded. In order to not be upset all my colleague would have to do is explain to me why it is important to them to have that particular week off. If the excuse wasn't valid than I really wouldn't associate with that person anymore and I would keep my distance at all costs. I would be the bigger one though and just move my vacation to another week. I think overall it would show me in a different light with my boss.
I would not be willing to change my plans either, unless I had not yet made the plans final and I could work it into my schedule to take the vacation another time. I'd say I'd be more flexible than the other person, just because I would want to avoid a conflict and make it work the best I could.
I would negotiate with my colleague first to figure out who can be a priority to take this vacation week. If my colleague cannot change their vacation plans I would reschedule my plans to take another week. Or I would ask another colleague to take my job duty during this week and I will also do it for he/she later on.
