I would first talk to my colleague about changing their vacation week. If that didn't work I would talk to my supervisor. I would ask who requested to have the week off first. If my colleague asked first then I would change my vacation week. If not, I would ask that my supervisor tell them to change their vacation.
I would be willing to give up my vacation time for my colleague. I would do this since I will be owed a favor from that colleague in the future for this sacrifice I'm doing for him. I would use that favor to help me advance my career.
It depended on my plans. If they are flexible, then I would be cool switching. If I had something planned where I was going to be traveling, then i would be more concerned. If my colleague didn't have to travel and I did, then i would approach them about the situation. If they still wouldn't change, then I would go to the supervisor to see if they could do something.
i would try to find out why the colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans. It would also depend upon why I asked for that particular week. If either or both of us have a specific reason for needing that week off, I would try to work with the colleague to see if we can schedule vacation so that we can both attend our events. If I was just taking a week for vacation, without any specific reason in mind, then I would probably be willing to take it a different week.
I would tell my colleague that I would be willing to move my vacation if he covered for me the next time. I would secure a hard to get week later in the year like Thanksgiving or Christmas by making a deal. If he agrees, I would consider it a win.
I would approach my colleague, find out his plans, compare them to mine and see which ones could be more easily adapted. If I am planning on actually going somewhere and have made the arrangements and bought the tickets, or paid for the hotels, I wouldn't be able to switch so easily. I might even hve to have a discussion with my supervisor and let him know when I applied for the time in relation to my coworker and the plans I have made.
I would ask my boss who requested the time off first. If we both requested it at the same time, the person who has seniority over the other should be allowed to take it, otherwise whoever asked for it first. I think this should also be the policy going forward.
I'd just take a different week off for my vacation. I'd probably stay home for my vacation anyway so it's not a big deal. But I'd make sure that colleague knows he owes me a favor.
I would first try to ascertain which of the two of us requested leave first.  If my colleague did, I would give up my claim on the date.  If I did, I would address to my supervisor the fact that I requested leave first for that date, and should therefore be given priority.  If I was unable to ascertain who had made the request first, or we had both made the request at the same time, I would request that the supervisor use some unbiased means (perhaps a coin flip) to determine who got to take their vacation and who had to reschedule.  Ultimately it is the supervisor's responsibility to deal with conflicts like thus, if there is no obviously right or wrong party.
I would try to reschedule my vacation week if possible just to keep things good between us. I would do whatever it takes to stay on good terms with my supervisor. I consider myself a team player, so I would try to work something out. and revise my plans.
I would likely change my plans.  It would depend on my personal situation.  If It was too disruptive to make the change, I would talk to my co worker to see if a deal could be made.
I would advice my colleague that he should try the best he can to change his vacation plans, as mine is already requested and is unlikely that he/she would get it granted above mine that was already sent. The company is unlikely to be unfair and move my week, in favor to your that was requested later.
I would lie to the employee I'm supposed to work it out with. I'd say that the vacation time is for the purpose of visiting some elderly family members who are ailing so that they would feel guilted into giving me the vacation time. If that didn't work, I'd insist to my manager that, based on either my seniority or (if that was not relevant), my value and hard work for the organization, that I should get the week off.
I believe the one who put in the request first should get the vacation.  If I was first I'd explain that and tell them that if they want a week off, they need to say something before I had mine planned. If they were first, I'd change my week.
I would try to change my plans. I prefer to maintain positive working relationships with my colleagues, so I would try to be accommodating. If traveling for a family reunion, wedding or other event that couldn't be changed, I would let my colleague know to see if, based on the additional information, they could change. If they still couldn't, I would ask my boss if she would be o.k. for both of us being out, for a day or two and if approved, I would just take a shorter vacation.
I would change my vacation time to accomodate my coworker. I would do this because it doesn't matter when I take vacation as long as I still get to take vacation. I would want to show my employer that I am flexible and a team player and it would reflect well on me.
I would consider whether they had worker there longer than me, If I had been there longer than them I would not back down but tell he boss that it has to done by te tie of hiring.If the other had been ther elonger than me I would change my plans for the vacation so there would be not hard feelings about it
I would most likely be more than willing to change my week.  I wouldn't have finalized my plans anyway, before I got the approval from my boss.  I would try to be nice and accommodating for both my boss and coworker and I would just take a different week.
I would reconsider my plans for vacation. If I have no commitments out of work (e.g. the vacation is needed to spend time with family), then I would change my plans.
I would not book a vacation without making sure I could get the days off first.  I would change my vacation dates.  I would then find the best deal for another date, especially if my co-worker already booked their vacation. Or I would find out who had the day reserved first.
I would say my vacation plans were not able to be changed and stick to taking my vacation. I don't feel like i should have to give up my plans if I already planned on taking it off. I might try and find someone to cover my work while I was absent.
I would not have a problem with rescheduling my vacation.  I would assume my colleague had big plans for his vacation.  Vacation for me would no doubt involve simply not being at work--no particular plans.
I would be willing to change my vacation request.  I would, however, require that I be given the opportunity to select whatever week I wanted outside of this week.  I would also hope that my manager note my flexibility in this issue.
I run into this all the time.  It would depend on what my plans were.  Did I have airline tickets that could not be changed.  Who made the request first.  If I made it first and had firm plans I would not change mine to accommodate them.  If I was just going to be around home than I would have no problem taking a different week as long as the same consideration was made for me in the future.
I would compromise in this situation and give up my week of vacation but only if I had not yet made reservations or paid nonrefundable deposits. I would graciously conceded my vacation to make my coworker happy. However, I would also make it clear that I will be taking my vacation at a later time and that I would get precedence over my coworker to take time off at that time.
I would say it is OK for this time but I will take the next vacation. I don't want to create a tension between us but I will make sure everything will be fair. I hope s/he will know that I try to understand his/her position but it has to be mutual.
I would also tell the boss that I'm not changing my plans and ask him what he wants us to do. I know if I have plans I've already purchases plane tickets and booked hotel rooms.
I would refuse to change my vacation plans, and invent all manner of excuses for why I could not do so. If that didn't work I would evaluate my situation and one of two things would happen:    1: I would quit right there, with likely a lot of profanity and telling them exactly what I thought of them.    2: Were my situation desperate I would change my vacation plans, but then my colleague would be marked. I would get even with that son of a bitch, one-way-or-another. The more I could make them suffer, the better, so long as it can't be proven that I was responsible.    I do not consider my coworkers to be "colleagues". I consider them to be people that I must tolerate to a degree in order to keep my job and income source. I will smile at them, and put up with their stupidity to an extent, but some things are intolerable to me. Affecting MY vacation, MY time away from these fools, is one of them!
I would ask my colleague what it would take to compromise on a solution. I would offer splitting the same week off with my colleague. I would then ask my supervisor if that was an equitable solution. I would propose dates before and after the week as a solution.
I would take my vacation at a different time then. I desire peace at work so I would try to seek a compromise with my colleague, gaining a preference for time at a later date. I see no reason not to be adult about the situation.
I would suggest that we see who requested the vacation first.  Then the first person would get it and the second would have to reschedule theirs.
I would try and negotiate with both my supervisor and colleague.  If for some reason they couldn't find a replacement for me for that time, I guess I will be forced to change my plans. Although, I don't want to have to do that, but maybe my supervisor would think that I am a flexible employee.
I would suggest that the first one of us to request the vacation days gets the vacation time.  I would assess the reason we both want vacations and see which is more valid and less movable.  I would consult our supervisor and make them make the decision based on what I wrote earlier.  I would take the time off if it were approved and I needed the time off unless the coworker had a strong reason to take off and I had a weak reason and the rescheduling of my vacation would not cause me undue hardship unless compensated by the organization
I would act depending on what my plans were. If I had something booked that was non-refundable, for instance, I would let my coworker know and see if we could work it out somehow. If I had an open week with no plans, I would have no problem with giving that particular week to my colleague and rescheduling my vacation time.
I would try to discuss it with my co-worker. I would give him my point of view so that he might be willing to change dates. If that is not possible i would suck it up and try to make another date work for me. I would want to know who requested time off first.
I would probably let my colleague take that time. I usually do not go anywhere on vacation, so it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  As long as I got another week off, I would be good.
I would discuss with my colleague about the reasons why they want those specific days for vacation and I would try to compromise with them on letting them have some of those days and keep the rest for myself. Of course if I don't have any particular reasons to take my vacation on that week, I could just let them have it.
It would depend on a few things.  Who had more seniority,  who put the time in first,  and who had someone to cover then while absent.  So it depends on those factors.
I would change my plans. My vacations are usually randomly planned and somewhat close to home. This would make it easier for me to move my vacation.
I would try to reason with them as I would like the vacation as well. If we cannot split the time then I would try to work out a way where I would be able to take off during the holiday months instead.
I would see if I could change my plans. Then I would immediately notify my supervisor of the new dates for my vacation. I would also notify my colleague of my new plans. I would let my colleague know that next time this happens, I will take my vacation as originally planned.
It would depend on several factors, but off the get go I would be upset. I would more than likely change my plans if push came to shove. I don't do well with personnel conflict issues. Also my plans are normally fluid for vacation.
I would speak to the employee and explain that I have been there longer, Also that I have children and I need to plan my vacations around there schedule and I would see if they would reconsider.
It would depend on how set my plans were. For example, if I was taking vacation because my daycare was closed that week, I'd have little room to budge. If I couldn't take it off, but couldn't be at work (like if my daycare was closed), I'd ask if I could work from home or flex my schedule instead. Also, maybe my colleague and I could split the week and both take half.
I would probably change my vacation plans if they weren't urgent. I am all about compromise and would rather reschedule than lose out on vacation. I also think its a waste of time to deal much with stubborn or difficult people.
I would look and see what I have planned at that time. If not a big deal, I would go ahead and change my plans. I would however check and see if we have duplicate times in the future, if so, I would ask I get the next time.
I would try to negotiate with the coworker. If they don't even try to act like they would try to accommodate the situation I would go ahead and change my plans and hope that the co worker would need me for something important. I woul d not help them with anything on purpose. I am pretty sure they would need me. And ask me for favors and I would gladly tell them no.
I would find out who asked for the vacation time first. If they asked first then I would be willing to move my week to another. If I asked first I would explain to the supervisor that I was the first to ask for that week and insist that I get it not my colleague.
I would tell him that he can have that week this year if he would agree on what I had to say next.  I would then tell him that if he agreed, I would get to choose my vacation week before him next year.  I would do this because I am easy to get along with.
I would first go to my supervisor to discuss if it is truly the case that only one of us could go. If that did not work I would go to the colleague and try to convince them again. I could compensate the colleague to not go that week.
I would allow my colleague to take the week of vacation he wants. This is because I do not want to be seen as difficult around the office. I am interested in being firm, but not difficult. I will allow myself a vacation on another week.
I grew up in a home where subservience was the norm and taking the back seat is no skin off my nose. My future plans are always made with a Plan-B so, I would like to be seen as gracious and willing to change my plans for a coworker and for my boss.
I would pick a different week. I would just change my plans. It would be very easy for me because im single and dont have many commitments.
I would have to make other plans.  I would ask if there are any available times.  I would ask if I could take the vacation pay and not take the time off.  I would see if I could rollover the vacation time to a future date.
Depending upon which of us had seniority, if I was less senior I would definitely change my plans to accommodate my coworker.  I would mention to my boss how inconvenient it is for me and that I would hope my gesture would be reciprocated.  If I was the more senior, I would make sure my supervisor realized this and ask to speak to human resources or my supervisor's supervisor.
If I could I would be willing to change my date. But if I had made the request first and I had serious plans I would not relinquish. I would argue with my boss and demand that I get the time off.
First, I would find out why they are unwilling to change. Has it been long since they've had a vacation? Is no other time available for them because of family constraints or season?
I would try to work something out with my fellow worker. Being flexible is important to me.  As alternative, we could present our case to our supervisor and let him decide which gets to go. Usually, however, first come, first served.
I would be flexible and let my coworker go ahead with his or her vacation plans and I would go another week.  Since by the description there's no indication of I have already committed money, reservations etc. to my upcoming vacation, I should be fine rescheduling.  By being flexible I would avoid conflict with a coworker whom I'd have to deal with after my vacation and I would demonstrate to my boss that I'm a team player unlike my coworker who is being insistent.  A little goodwill can go a long way to keep myself in good graces with others.
I would would have to discuss it with my colleague. If I were taking that week off for a specific event, I would try to convince my colleague to take a different week of vacation. But if they needed that week for something more important than what I have planned, I would let them take that week.
It would be dependent on several circumstances, but if I had already made the request for the time off, the logical decision would be that he was 2nd to make the request and therefore it's too late for them. I would make sure my manager knew this. If it were an instance where my time off request were simply to stay at home, I would have no problem simply shifting my plans and offering to do so to accommodate his time off. If I had booked travel arrangements (car, plane, etc.) then I would certainly be far less willing to accommodate his situation and push back.
I would change my plans. I would try to do this now so that if this happens in the future maybe they would help me out. I would not want to make a big deal about it.
I would talk to my supervisor directly and right away. I would tell the supervisor why I could not change my plans. I would also show them my travel plans and any proof of my vacation.
I would probably try to be flexible and change my own plans. I usually put others before me and try to please everyone. I would want to help my coworker but also look good to my boss.
I would talk with my colleague to see if he/she would consider changing vacation weeks. I would explain why I needed this particular time so he/she would be more willing to select a different time. If that did not work, I would speak with my supervisor to see what other weeks were available and plan accordingly.
I would go ahead and switch my vacation week.  Personally that kind of stuff does not bother me.  However I would keep that in the back of my mind next time something comes around.  I would not fret about it much at all though.
i would have to change my plans. i would not be happy about it at all and im sure it would cause a rift between us. but all in all, it would have to be me one way or another sadly.
I would like to know who has seniority in this instance and that is who should get the requested vacation time. This should be a question for the supervisor and not for us to have to decide. If the supervisor will not help, I will forgo my plans and schedule it at another time.
I would be willing to deal with my co-worker, with the understanding that they would owe me a favor. That's far more useful than having an angry co-worker, and I get to take the vacation anyway. I would try to cancel my plans to minimize loss of money.
I would change my vacation instead because I don't want any drama. If I had preplanned a vacation with other people then I would probably try to come to a compromised with my coworker. Hopefully they wouldn't be jerk about it and reschedule.
I would take to the person and see if we can come to an agreement. I think that whoever asked for time off first should be able to get that week. If they are able to agree to that than I think it can be handled with little issue.
I would change my vacation plans unless there was some serious reason that my plans couldn't be changed. The only reasons I would not agree to change my plans would be if I had planned to attend an 'event' (for example a wedding) that couldn't be changed, or if I had made reservations with non-refundable tickets, or if I would really inconvenience other people that I was planning the vacation with. I want to be flexible and get along with other people at work. It doesn't matter if the other employee is being selfish or unreasonable. It might lower my opinion of them that they are acting this way, but I don't mind having the other employee 'get their way'.
I would see how badly i needed that particular week and change if possible.  If not i would go to my boss and appeal since time off is important.
I would make a decision based off of what I have planned for my vacation. If I'm going on a trip I can't cancel, if I'm just staying home I would reschedule it.
I would be more than happy to change my vacation plans if it doesn't involve any extra expense on my part. I usually take my vacations during my son's summer vacation from school, so I usually have two months in which to do what I want. However, if there is an extra expense involved, I would ask for my boss to either reconsider or help me with the added cost. I know that the girls in my department are perfectly able to do without me because we have organized ourselves in a way that covers all bases.
I would change to keep the peace and look like the good guy. I think that the boss would also remember my act in the future and it would I would be a team player in this event. I can take a hit now too get something later.
I would see if I could take vacation in a different week. I would have a talk with my colleague and determine why he doesn't want to change. If his reason is sound and I can change my plans, I would volunteer to change my vacation week.
I would politely ask why they were unable to change their plans and see if we could work something out that would be to both of our benefits. Maybe I change my plans if they are will to let me be off first the next time I want to go away. If that doesn't work, keep my plans and leave it up to the manager to decide. That should be part of their job anyway.
I would take a different vacation time and not make an issue out of it. I'm not inflexible when it comes to issues like this one; as long as I have time off, it doesn't really matter when I take it. Chances are good that my colleague has some sort of family commitment that is involved with his or her vacation plans; I personally would not let that stand in my way of changing my plans. So, being more flexible, I would re-arrange my time off.
If I am able to change my vacation to another week I would. I don't see a point in making a big deal out of it if I can easily change the dates. It's vacation, I could take it anytime I want doesn't have to be a specific date.
If it was impossible to get my colleague to change their vacation plans, I would probably try to change mine. I would see if there was another week available that I could take off. The reason for this would be to keep peace with my colleague and also help my company during this time. I would make myself available to work during the time that my colleague was on vacation.
I would accept to move my vacation date.  I don't want to cause any issues and I feel that I could easily change my plans. I also don't want to be confrontational.
I would change my plans and go on vacation another week. I would be annoyed that my coworker won't help out the situation. I think it is more important to take a vacation at a different time than not take on at all.
I would start by trying to bargain with them.  I would offer to work for them a different week if they let me take my vacation on the week planned.  If they don't budge, I might offer them a little money to reschedule their vacation.  If we couldn't reach an agreement, I would suggest flipping a coin or drawing straws to see who gets to take the vacation that week.
I would change my dates if it was reasonable to do so. However depending on who first submitted the vacation request should be allowed to have that time. The other person who submitted last should be required to change their dates.
I would determined if my plans could be changed. My flexibility could be viewed favorably in the future. My willingness to cooperate could lead to future opportunities. I would discuss my decision with my family in order to determine the best course of action for the long term.
I would discuss this with them but I really feel I would let them keep that week off and pick another week for myself. I have no family nor pets and I am therefore able to be quite flexible with my time, which might not be the case with this colleague.
I would probably be willing to be flexible. I'm able to have a good time in just about any time and place, so having my vacation tied to a particular week doesn't feel essential to me. I would hope that the coworker would be appreciative and help me if I needed it later.
I would ask my colleague why they needed that time. I would ask if it were possible to be moved. I would then try and move my commitment if I could.
It would depend on the situation, but I would probably change with the person. I wouldn't make any big plans without requesting, and making sure I received the time off, well in advance. But if I really needed the time off I would try to work something out with the other employee, and worse case scenario I would request to know who asked for the time off first, as that would be a fair way to deal with it.
I would go ahead and change my vacation plans. I spend a lot of time at work and need to get along with my co-workers. Hopefully by sacrificing that particular week, I show I'm professional and easy to work with.
I would change my vacation plans cheerfully and not worry about it. This provides for better outcomes for my relationships with my colleague and with my supervisor. It also preserves or enhances my reputation. Most importantly, it simplifies my life and makes me happiest. My reponse is the most rational response I can make. The specifics of time off from work are generally not critical.
I would just shift my week of vacation to the next week over. It's the easiest path with the least amount of resistance. It also avoids any workplace conflict, even though I feel I'm giving in.
I would point out that since we are on an equal footing, my coworker has no more (or less) right to the week off than me.  Unless I absolutely needed the week, I'd probably give in, but insist on some sort of compensation:  most likely, that the next time this situation arose, I'd get preference.
I would feel obligated to move my vacation but also feel resentful. I would hopefully not have purchased tickets already. I think if I did I would also them refuse to move.
Before anything, I would be willing to concede if my colleague had asked before me and would expect the same from them. If I asked first but didn't have anything planned, I would give my colleague that week. If I did have plans (family event/wedding/baby), I would explain how important this event was to me and would explain why I couldn't give it up.
I would see who requested the vacation first.  If it were me, I would request the other person change their week.  If it was the other person, I would change my plans.  If we couldn't come to an agreement, I would make the supervisor decide.  It shouldn't be up to me to make the decision on who does what.  The co-worker seems unreasonable to me.
I would very likely switch my vacation to another week. This would depend on whether I had important plans, such as purchased tickets or a special event for the week. If I did have a special need for vacation that week I would speak with the supervisor and let her know my specific needs.
I wouid try talking to him first to see if he has any plans or  trip scheduled for the vaca that he cant change. Then i would compare it to my plans and if i have nothing big planned that would be hard to reschedule then i would gladly let him have the week vaca instead. If i had a trip though then i would have to refuse to give it up since hotel booking and plane tickets cost money and i wouldnt want to lose out on money on my vaca. So whichever one of us has the harder to change plans then that person will get the vaca first. that would be the reasonable way to go about it.
I would change my plans. It sounds as though my colleague may have plans that involve considerable travel and hotel reservations, so, assuming he's locked in to these plans, I'd be willing to change mine.
I would schedule my vacation a different week. My colleague seems to be unwilling to compromise, so there would be no point in arguing with them. I can be flexible.
I would want to know when they had put in for their vacation, if I had put in first for the time off, then I should be the one to get the time off. If we asked at the same time, it would depend on whose vacation was able to be refunded or the dates changed. If I could change mine then I happily would.
I would most likely give in to him or her. I don’t like confrontation, and I will adjust my schedule to avoid it. Unless I had something already specifically planned, I would not put up a fight about it.
I would change my vacation plans and take my vacation one week after my colleague. This is because I believe in my colleague and I would not want there to be an issue at all with my supervisor and not getting time off because only one of us gets it. Also, I believe that it's the right thing to do given the circumstances of the situation and then I would still get my vacation time off no problem at all.
It would honestly depend on what I was taking the vacation for and how much I had already committed. In the most relevant case, I have 2 weeks blocked off for a wedding in the UK in August that I already have everything arranged for. I would bring the tickets, hotel reservations etc to show how much I had already put into this and refuse to budge. I feel like the way this is worded, I had mine in first so they can get over it.
He's not willing to change his schedule. That just says he's the type who's not willing to cooperate with others. There is very little i can do here but to appease him and hope i don't have to work with him on anything. hopefully the boss noticed it and values my willingness
I would take the opportunity to allow him this week. I would then adjust my schedule to vacation some other time. I don't need a specific time to vacation.
If it was already a paid vacation or something important with family members, I also wouldn't be willing to budge. The employer in this case must ask someone else to work overtime to compensate. There should be enough employees or one that is willing to work in this situation. My vacation is just as important as the other colleague.
I would weigh my options. If my plans are set and the specfic week is needed I would push for me to get the week off. If my time is flexible I would adjust. No reason to make things more difficult.
I would suggest that whoever requested the time off first be given priority.  Unless for some reason the vacation can't be rescheduled, maybe because it's been paid for already and can't be refunded.  If that's the case, then I would understand and change my plans.
I would try to reach some sort of compromise. Assuming no concrete plans were made by either party, I would try to work with my colleague to determine an alternative time one or both of use could use our vacation. For example, if he/she is generally busier than I for personal reasons (family etc), then I would likely look to change my vacation time since it would be more difficult for him/her to find an appropriate vacation time.
I would try to take to him one on one to come up with a solution.  For instance if he wants to take this vacation this time and I will have to work, the next time both of us requests vacations on the same day, I would have priority. This way I'll take the hit but won't feel at a disadvantage in the future. I would probably also talk to my manager to let him know that my co-worker can take the vacation but that in the future, I hope that I would get first priority.
I would try and let them know about my plans.  I would see if we could both rtake it at same time.  Try and organize with clients.
I'd let my colleague take vacation.  I don't vacation anyway. It's not my style. I staycation.  But I can do that any time.  And I can find ways to cut my effort at work.
I would first take a look at my coworkers and I relationship and depended on how that is decide how to move forward.  If I had a good relationship with that coworker i would save face and just choose a different week.  If we didn't get along so well then it would be a different story.  I would contact HR and determine who has the right to have it off first, what every their policy is.
I would like to see possibility to reschedule my vacation if possible. I'm a frequent flyer user, so changing schedule mostly won't be an issue for me. Aside from that, I mostly not making any major reservation until I'm getting closer to the vacation week.
I would probably be more likely to just accept that I cannot go that week. I would first try and see who planned their vacation first. However, I am more of a pushover and willing to make others happy, especially at work. I do not like to upset others.
I would be willing to change my vacation plans as long as they have not already been booked. If they have already been booked, I will politely yet passive-agressively inform my colleague that my plans are nonrefundable and ask if he or she would cover the cost so that I can go a different week. If my plans are not set in stone, I'm willing to change them.
I would first ask my colleague why they need the same week off as me. I would then ask my supervisor which one of us has been there longer and deserves the chosen week more. I would try and see if there's any reason why I couldn't change my plans and pick a different week. My last choice would to offer my colleague cash or a favor to change their week.
I would ask why they couldn't change (family, booked flights, etc.) and think about if it was possible for me to make slight changes. If it was possible for me to make changes, and my colleague has a good reason I would go ahead and change (to be a "team player" and helpful to my probably nice coworker). If not I would plead my case as to why I should be allowed to have vacation that week. I would also see if it would be possible to plan out work in advance so that we both could go the same week after all - but if my plans couldn't be changed I would definitely prioritize my own interests.
It would depend on whether or not I had non-refundable deposits etc in place, and if I had requested off before them or not. If I requested, for example, in January for May, and they requested during the last week of April for May, then too bad, so sad; I'm not changing my plans. If, however, it didn't make much difference to be what week I took (if I was taking a staycation, for example), I'd be willing to swap for the sake of office harmony.
I would look at how necessary it was for me to take  vacation that specific week.  I would consider approaching my colleague to see if we could come to some compromise if I really needed that exact time frame.  I would do this because sometimes talking directly to someone can yielded different results than if you're dealing through an intermediary...in this case: the boss.
If I didn't already have firm plans I would give it up.  If I did have firms plans I would push the supervisor to decide based on who submitted a request first.
I would move my vacation plans. Only one of us can be gone from work that week. If my colleague refuses to change his vacation dates than I will have to.
I would change when I took vacation time. If I had already made plans or booked tickets somewhere, I would request some sort of compensation for any expenses that arose from having to change my plans. Another idea is to see who asked for the vacation time first and let the person who asked first keep their plans.
I would ask my supervisor who has seniority in this commpany. If i have more years than my colleague I will take my vacation days as scheduled. If my colleague is my senior, I will simply use my vacation day in another week.
I would first assess the situation objectively. I would consider my plans for the vacation and determine if I could carry out those plans at a different time. If it would work for my spouse and family, I would definitely agree to let my colleague have that time slot for their vacation. Otherwise, I would ask my superior to determine in a fair way, say by time on job or other method to determine fairness. If a mutual agreement could not be reached, I'd have to consider how important the job is to me because sometimes you just have to make a choice between fairness and necessity.
I would see whether or not I could move my plans. It would be dependent on what I already had planned. If it is something I could not move I would try and negotiate with my colleague because it isn't fair to cancel something you already have reservations for.
I would let my collegue have the time if they were a close personal friend, and maybe just a colleague.  If it was really a terrible loss for me to not take that time, if I lost money, or it would hurt my family, I might stand my ground, but people remember these slights, I would not forget that they would not give in.
I would take a different week of vacation. However, I would only do that if I did not have outstanding obligations on that vacation week. If I did, I would negotiate with my colleague.
I would make the sacrifice.  I would make sure my colleague is aware as well as my boss. I would make sure that they know the next time this happens, I will get the vacation.
I would try to make a simple appeal on who asked for this vacation first.  That might be sufficient to receive a favorable response from my supervisor, if I was indeed the first to request this time off.  Failing that, I would try to reason with my colleague to see if perhaps some kind of arrangement could be made.  Perhaps (s)he would offer something in return for this vacation time, or would allow me to take it in return for some other favor at work.  If all else failed, I would recognize that it is my responsibility to help out at work during a busy time, so I would reschedule my vacation.  However, I would ask for something in return for the disruption this had caused to my vacation plans--perhaps some extra time off during a slower period.
I would be willing to compromise with my coworker if they give me an assurance that they won't take their next vacation during my vacation time. I would be reasonable and try to be friendly and kind. I would seek to make a friend out of a difficult situation.
I would change my vacation date.  It would be a nice thing to do.  Plus it doesn't interfere with my plans.  Hopefully this will work out for both of us.
