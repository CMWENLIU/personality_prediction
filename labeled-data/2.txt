I would find out why they want/need the week off. If they needed the week off for a particular reason and I had flexibility in my week off, I would just adjust my request. However, if the co-worker did not have plans and/or I had something scheduled, I would end up filing a grievance with the union.
I would have a conversation with both my colleague and supervisor to discuss what can be done about the situation. Depending on who has a more important engagement during their vacation if my colleagues was more important I wouldn't have a problem giving them the week. I would expect my colleague to extend the same gratitude if a similar situation came up in the future.
I would first try and talk with the other colleague and see if there would be a way to compromise.  I would see if it would be possible to maybe change a few of both of our dates of vacation so that maybe we could split the week up, but also add parts of the weeks on either side.  If this doesn't seem to be something that will work, I would look at changing my vacation plans and what my other options would be.
I would try to talk to my colleague first and see if they were possibly able to change their mind about not changing their plans. If they still wouldn't change I would talk to my supervisor if I had more seniority. If all else fails I mind end up having to change my plans.
First I would discuss with my colleague regarding the reasons for our vacations and determine their priority. I would then ask if there are any fixed costs that are already tied to his plan at those dates. After deliberating, if his situation is more serious, I would be willing to concede, but not otherwise.
I would say fine whatever. I don't have time to play little games with petty people. I'll be the bigger person and change mine. Because if you argue this with her, after her saying she was sticking to her guns...she is going to make your life living hell the whole time you work together.
I would research my own travel plans and try and adjust accordingly so I can go another week without any hassle. However, if my travel plans are time sensitive or critically important then I would discuss this with my coworker
I would look and see if my vacation could be done right after my coworker. If not, I would speak to my colleague and explain why I need to take the time off at that specific time. If the employee still disagrees I will explain to my supervisor why I need the time off and leave the decision to them.
I would ask them why they are not able to change their vacation plans. Then I would see if they would negotiate a better vacation plan to where we wouldn't take the vacations at the same. Also, I would tell my boss that he approved my vacation and he should honor it.
I would determine who put the request in first. If my colleague did then I would change my plans. However if it was me then I would go to HR.
I would try to alter my plans.  I would also try to understand my coworker's situation.  Sometimes vacations have to be a certain time to attend an event.  I think that being willing to change or negotiate would help me look like more of team player.
I would ask my manager if it was possible for him or her to hire a temp. If they said no, then I would ask them to see who put in for the vacation first. I think it would only be fair to give it to the person who asked first
I would basically go with the "first come, first serve" mentality. If my co-worker had put in for it first, I'd delete my request, and put in for a different date. But if I had put in the request first, I would meet with my supervisor (and probably co-worker) to discuss my thoughts and reasons for not being willing to budge.
I would keep with my plans if I had already requested them before that person. I would probably switch the dates if I hadn't already gotten an approval just to help the company out.  If the people I am going on vacation with can't switch then I would make sure I told my supervisor that other people in my party have already put in for those dates and can't switch, so I would not switch.
I would see if my plans were able to be changed.  If they weren't, I would fight to keep the vacation.  I wouldn't back down.
First, I would see I there would be any way I could reschedule my vacation week. If I can, then I would and let my colleague have that vacation week. If I can't, I would talk to my colleague and see if we can work something out. If not, the last resort would be both of us going to the supervisor and having them decide.
I would do my best to change my vacation time. If it was an issue where I absolutely couldn't reschedule then I would approach my co-worker and speak to them about the issue explaining that I would change if I could. I would also assess why they need that particular time off. I would do my best to come to a peaceful resolution where we are both satisfied.
If they requested the time off before me, I would accept it and move my vacation. However, if they asked for the time off after I did, I would stand my ground and defend my reasoning. I would talk it over with my boss to make sure he understands my side of the situation.
I would change my plans. I believe this would be most helpful in accommodating my vacation, my coworkers vacation and our workload. If it for some reason could not be changed at all, I would look to see if there was someone else who could help with the workload.
I would go over the calendar with my colleague and manager and schedule out an alternate time. I would also ask to get first pick on the next vacation period. Showing a bit of goodwill early will payoff later. By being gracious about it, I'm showing my willingness to be a team player to both my coworkers and management.
I would ask my colleague if they had definitive plans that could not be changed.  If they had airfare or a vacation planned I would understand.  If they did not and I did i would try and convince them to let me have the week.
I would change my vacation to a different week. I can likely make my vacation plans work for another time. I am not picky about when I take vacation.
I would just go ahead and tell my supervisor I was willing to change my vacation dates. Since my colleague is refusing to change their plans, I would just find it easier not to fight them on it. I don't like drama and try to avoid it as much as possible.
I'd give in and let them have it because I'm a pushover like that and also because I don't go anywhere anymore
I would flip a coin, or at least offer to flip a coin. I wouldn't just back down and give in to them immediately. Unless they had a funeral or a family event, I would say that I still want to be in the running for that week. A coin flip is as fair as it can get.
I would demand that who ever has more senority get the desired week off. it does not matter who wins in the end, as long as it is fair. And nothing is more fair than getting something extra over someone else because you have devoted more time to the company.
I would ask the supervisor to do a couple of things.  Check to see if we both followed the proper procedure in requesting time off.  Secondly, I would ask him who requested time off first.  Whomever requested time off first should get the vacation at the requested time.
I would be the bigger person and change my plans. I have no children so I don't have that as a conflict. I feel like as a single woman, that I need to be more flexible than the family people. If I had a big trip planned, and I already paid for it I would not be happy and I would not change my plans. I would ask that the person with less seniority change their plans or to be more fair, whoever asked first should get it.
I would switch with them if what I was doing was not pressing. If it was something that could not be changed, like needing to move a child away to college, I would not switch. If it came down to it, I would see who requested off first.
I would be willing to change my vacation time with my colleague.  I would do this out of respect for my fellow worker while trying to maintain harmony at the office.  The only exception to this would be if I had a commitment or money spent on a vacation myself that could not be changed.  If that was the case I would do my best to work with my colleague and boss to make sure the time and work could get done.
I would be upset, but as this scenario is written, I have no choice but to change my vacation.  I would probably also ignore my colleague for a while, as I would need some time to cool off.  Then, I would take time to try to understand why he/she was so unwilling to change their plans.
I WOULD GO AHEAD AND CHANGE MY DATE IF I HAVE NOT MADE ANY RESERAVATIONS. I WOULD DO IT TO AVOID AND FUSS AT WORK. IT WOULD BE NO BIG DEAL AS LONG ALSO IF IT IS NOT LAST MINUTE
I would be willing to switch vacation days because they are not willing to change their vacation and there is no reason to try to make my supervisor make them change. It would be easier if I just changed it and then chose another vacation day that I would like to take. I would be very unhappy if my supervisor were to choose me to take the vacation if they were brought into it and I would rather maintain control over the situation. I think it would also look better on me for being willing to switch and might help me in the future.
The first thing I would do is reflect on what type of vacation it is. If I already have previous engagements at a place, then I would talk to my colleague and try to negotiate something. If I did not have previous engagements, then I would talk to my colleague and probably change the times around to work with my supervisor's schedule.
I would be upset at the other colleague.  I would try to reason with the other colleague.  I would end up changing my own plans.
I would take my vacation as well. I am just as deserving as everyone else in the workplace. I am not a tool to make money, I am a human being.
I would simply base the decision on who gets the vacation time approved, on who submitted the request first. It makes sense that whoever has been planning for vacation longest should get it. It's unfortunate, however, that both of us can't go due to work needs. Hopefully in the future there will be enough employees to accommodate these types of requests
I will still go on vacation because it is my right. I will not care  if someone is there or not. it is my right and my colleaugues right so the company can cover up for both of us somehow
I WOULD MAKE THE DECISION FOR THE VACATION FOR THE SAME DAYS, BUT THE COLLEAGUE IS NOT CONVINCE TO CHANGE THEIR PLANS BECAUSE OF THEIR PLANS ARE VERY ACTIVELY AFFAIRS FOR THE FAMILY AND THE MANY OF FUNCTION RELATED SITUATIONS.  BUT MY PURPOSE IS ONLY FOR THE FAMILY AND SPEND VACATION TIME FOR THE FRIENDS AND THE SOME OF THE TRAVEL DESTINATIONS SO KINDLY I CAN CHANGE THE TIMING AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE MY PLANS IN THE VACATION TIMING AND DELIVERS SOME OF THE DECISION FOR THE COLLEAGUE
I would move my vacation. If I had plans, I am certain they could be rearranged. I would take full advantage of the "brownie points" I would earn for being willing to change my request.
I would ask myself if it's something that would be easy for me to change. If I hadn't made any concrete plans (bought tickets, reservations the cannot be cancelled etc.) I would bring in this evidence to show my supervisor. It really also depends on who requested the week off FIRST. Did we both know about this policy beforehand? Was both our vacations approved and then retroactively they decided we both couldn't take the same week off? If nothing else I would try to have a private conversation with my coworker about who has more at stake if they cancelled plans. There are so many other facets to this question that would need to be explored.
I would try to move my vacation if possible. If my vacation could not be moved, because relatives or friends were attending, or I could not get a refund on reservations, I would try to convince my colleague to change. Maybe I could offer them a favor in return.
I would move around my plans.  There is not much that can't be put off until the next week.  I would make sure that I left my stuff done for my vacation week.
I would let the co-worker take the week off if they requested the time prior to me. If so, I would chose a different week to go. If the co-worker requested the time off after me, I would speak with the manager saying that it is only fair that I get the time since I requested it first.
I would stand my ground and let the supervisor decide who should stay to work for the week. I wouldn't attempt to talk the colleague into working the week. I would compromise if any incentive to work in the week was given.
I would attempt to work out a deal with my colleague for splitting the vacation time of that week.  I understand that both of us would want to have that time off, but it would only be fair if a compromise could be met.  If the other employee was insistent on not changing their vacation and we both had a equal standing seniority/or first come first serve wise, I would then push to get it for myself based on my value to the business.  Either way, my colleague would understand either to compromise or risk losing entirely.
I would be considerate and let my coworker take a vacation during that time. I will take my vacation the following week. I feel that if the same situation were to happen again, they will return the favor for me and let me have the week off.
Putting my boss in a difficult situation is not advantageous to me or my colleague. It would be weighed against both of us. Therefore I would pick a different week for my vacation. This way all concerned parties would be happy.
I would definitely move my vacation week.  In the modern world almost everything is changeable and it is possible to modify or change plans easily.  So the particular week of my vacation would not be a sticking point with me.  I have actually done this in the past.
I feel I would approach them and ask if there's any way to change their vacation days. I'd also like to know if I had sent in my request before they did. If I did, I would mention that I had put in a request before they did. I would probably change my vacation time if they were unwilling
I would be willing to change my vacation plans to keep peace in the office.  However, I would make a mental note that I have done this.  If this issue were to come up again in the future with this same colleague I would recall this mental note and how I willingly changed my vacation plans to accommodate theirs.  We all need to be flexible in the office to be sure everyone gets their time off to get refreshed and come back to work renewed.
I would see if there was any way i could switch vacation times with him if he was unwilling i would ask my boss if there was a way i could take my vacation at a later time when no one else was taking their's.
I would converse with my colleague about it and see if there is any wiggle room on when they can go. If they are unwilling to budge, I would ask them if they wanted to flip a coin for it. If they were unwilling to do that, I would see who submitted first, and if it is mine I would insist that they work instead of me.
I would first ask my colleague if we could talk. I'd then find out what their plans were and if we could come to some kind of compromise. If not, if I had something pre-planned, I'm going anyway.
I would be disappointed that I was not going to be able to get the time I wanted off.  However, I would not put up a fight and would let me colleague have the time off.  I would reschedule my vacation for a convenient time for myself and the company.
I would feel that I would have no choice but to change my vacation plans. I would not want to make the company suffer for my absence and I think it will make me look better in the long run to be flexiable with my vacation request to my management. I wouldn't be very happy about it and would resent the co-worker who refused to change thier vacation plans, but I would not want to lose my job over something so petty.
Depending on what the vacation was about, I would probably be the bigger person and just wait for another time. If they are unwilling to budge then it's worth it to be seen as the more mature figure.
I would do it, because I know my supervisor is being mindful f the reactions from both of us. Also, I would use this against them later. I am vengeful sometimes. I know that a situation like this may come up in the future.
I would probably not change my plans for vacation because it would cause everyone in my family to have to change their plans as well if the plans and reservations, as well as time requested off of work have already been approved by their supervisors and other arrangements made. I would explain that my family has already made arrangements with their employers, schools, etc. This would be something very important to me, because I do not make last minute vacation plans. I plan well in advance.
I would offer to stay at work.  I would give up my week for a different week as long as I didn't have something that was only doable at a specific time.  I would do this because as a Christian I believe that I should sacrfice my time when necessary.
I would see if there is a compromise or if who's plans are more important. I would like to see we can work something out and I am willing to change. Another alternative would be finding someone else for coverage.
in this kind of a situation, I would just surrender. I would let the other coworker take the vacation and just go another time. It is an inconvenience, but i took this job so i have to deal with it.
I would also not be willing to change my plans. I've made vacation plans for almost a year and everything is set. It is impossible for to cancel everything just because two of us can't take vacation the same week. I would put in for leave of absence to be able take my week vacation.
I would let them take the vacation. My schedule is typically flexible and I could reschedule for a different week. It would be no issue.
Depending on the circumstances and if I had plans that could be moved, I might just let my colleague take the week without any protest.  If that was the case however I would want first choice for the next year.
I would agree to change my vacation plans unless I had already booked the itinerary, which in that case I would let both him and my supervisor know this, with proof. If my itinerary was not booked yet, and nothing had been prearranged, then I would change my vacation week. However, I would request that moving forward, there be better polices in place regarding PTO. For instance, those with seniority have priority or possibly a "first come, first serve" policy.
It would depend on how serious my plans were. If I were going on vacation for example and I already had my tickets purchased for whatever I was going to, I wouldn't budge and say I need that week. Now if I just wanted time off then I would take a different week off that year.
I would try to make a deal with my co-worker. I would say that I would give it up if they would give me something in return. I would also ask who scheduled it first. I would try ot convince my supervisor to let us both have it.
I would not be willing to switch if I got my request in on time and was first.  If I requested second I might be willing to switch.  I would probably try to negotiate with my colleague and see whose plans might already have a fiscal commitment or any other specific details of the vacation.    If I were forced to under threat of say losing my job,  I would stay.  But if not, I would probably leave anyway especially if this was a pre planned trip that I had already committed a substantial amount of money into.
I would offer to change my plans if they could potentially cover a day for me sometime in the future.  I feel like i am quite reasonable and dont usually like to start any kind of confrontation at work.  These are people that i have to see everyday so i would prefer to not make anything seem awkward.
I would just cancel my plans if it was easy enough to change the date. It'd be quick and simple, not to mention it'd probably look good to my supervisor. However, I'd be doing all I can to persuade my if it wasn't easy. If that means paying my colleague to stay behind this week, then so be it.
I would probably just go ahead and change my vacation plans.  I never make permanent plans or reservations before ensuring that I am able to be on vacation.  If a colleague was unwilling or unable to change their plans it would not bother me to change mine.  I have always put work and my career as more important that vacation.  This has actually happened to me and since I was in a position that the week I needed was for a wedding, my colleague changed their plans.  I think what goes around comes around.
I would probably go ahead and let my coworker have the week, if I hadn't already scheduled plans. I tend to shoot for the approval first, then make the plans, to avoid this type of matter. I wouldn't let it affect me too much, and I would be sure to let the supervisor know, to remember my leniency.
It depends. If I have planned ahead of time, and can not change it, I would talk to my colleague and try to persuade him to change their vacation plans. If my vacation is flexible, it is fine, and I would change my plan and let him to take vacation.
It would depend what they are doing on their vacation. I would try to working things out if the things they were going to do had more meaning or importance than mine.
I would ask my co-worker why they cannot change their plans, perhaps they have to attend an event or have already booked their flight, etc... If my own plans are flexible, I would adjust them to another date to avoid conflict.  If we both cannot agree, I would expect the supervisor to make the deciding decision depending on who asked for the time first, or if there are other deciding factors.
I would let my boss know that it is unfair. Hopefully, one of us asked first and the second person will just have to re-schedule their vacation. Most places I've worked for over the last 44 years go by seniority and who put the request in first. It's only fair.
I would most like change my vacation plans. Obviously, if one person has to change and the other won't, then it's up to the second person to change. I'm pretty flexible, anyway.
I would try to discuss how important stuff my colleague will be doing in that vacation. If it is something important and personal, i would change the plan
If my plans were flexible and I had no reservations that could not be rescheduled, I would change my vacation time. If I had already made commitments that would cause me to lose out on opportunities or lose deposits, I would point this out to my colleague and ask if they were under similar constraints. If they were unreasonable, I would appeal to my supervisor.
I would first try to convince my colleague and if he gave a solid reason why he is not willing to change his vacation plans, i will manage my plan as I want peace and I want to relax on my vacation, I would not be able to spend my vacation nicely if I took them under pressure. also I do not want my supervisor to face any problem so I would adjust.
I would change my vacation plans. I usually plan to spend time with family. I would just need to let them know I am coming a different week.
I would, depending on how important the time off I r would inquire about who requested it off first, because that should be the only deciding factor. Those are really the only two options.
I would not give mine up either. It may look bad but I will not be walked over. If the other people are not willing to negotiate then either am I.
If I have scheduled flights or events, I would also not willingly change my vacation plans.  I would leave the decision to my supervisor.  If, however, I do not have definitive plans, I would be happy to rearrange my vacation plans to help my colleague.
I would ask the coworker what he had specifically so we could figure out who's schedule is less likely to be malleable, but also depending on company policy I might ask the boss to make an exception as most companies have a policy of asking for time off ahead of time. In the end, I'm not confrontational, and If I could find a way to rearrange my vacation, I would.
I guess I would change my plans if he refused.  I would be upset but I would hope that maybe my willingness to change would garner me favor with my supervisor.  I would hope that it would show flexibility on my part.
I would ask the supervisor who requested that week first. If it was him, I would change my week and make different plans. If I requested it first, I would try to get that week off myself. I would talk to the supervisor and tell him I was unwilling to change, I requested it first, and that I should get it.
I would approach them about their plans. Assuming my plans arent as important as his I would cede and plan a different week. If I view mine as more important I would sit down and express that with them.
I would let them take the time off. I would tell them that if we have this problem again then it would be their turn to step back. It is not that serious. I would just let them have the time.
If we talked about it early enough I would shift my week. I live alone and have a pretty flexible lifestyle. I am also a Libra and avoid conflict whenever possible. A lot depends too on how long we colleagues have worked alongside each other, and what is the future of our employment here.  Also, I am not really much of a vacation type person, seldom using the days allotted by my job each year.
i would consider changing my vacation week to some other dates. i would try to find out why my colleague is unwilling to change his dates. if there is good enough reason, better than mine, then i will make the sacrifice.
I would find out what everyone's plans are. The plans would be my deciding factors and if someone was going to lose money etc. I would then have the decision made by an unbiased choice maker.
I would probably change, assuming that I do not have money already sunk into a planned vacation.  In that case, assuming that I had already booked, I would stick to my guns or ask for compensation.  In that scenario I presumably asked first and already spent money in good faith and would expect the company to support me.
I would ask my supervisor to make a decision based on seniority. If she fails to do that, I may consider taking my grievance to Human Resources. I would also ask if both of us could take the same vacation and use a temp service to cover our work.
I would state the reasoning why I had requested the vacation to be that week and ask her to state her reasoning. If her reasoning was better, then I would tell her she could have that week and I will take another. If she was being difficult and could not come up with good reasoning, then I would take it to my supervisor again.
I would agree to go into work during the week my coworker is absent. We would have a conversation about me taking off another time in the future. All parties involved would be considerate of each other.
If they weren't willing to change their time off then I would change mine. I wouldn't be happy about it and I would remember it for the future, but I would do so, since someone has to be at work to keep things from getting crazy.
I would evaluate my vacation plans to see if they could be changed first. I like to be accommodating, so if I could make a different week work, then I would do so. If not, I would ask my colleague to compromise with me so that maybe the next time this situation happens, I would get to go on vacation, and they would stay at work.
It would really depend on my colleague's situation. Like if they have children and that is the only time they can take a vacation because of school, etc. In this situation I guess I would take a different week, but if it happened again in the future I would hope my colleague would change their plans instead.
I would offer to pay my colleague if they could change their week. If not I would rearrange plans with my family. I would tell my boss we need to do things differently next year. I would try to talk to my colleague in advance about the next vacation.
Assuming I can't change my plans either, I would probably talk to the supervisor about things. I don't think it's fair that the coworker should be able to essentially bully me into trying to not take my vacation week. However, if I can easily change my plans, I probably wouldn't push it because I would rather not deal with the conflict.
Apperenly I have a choice in  the matter. It would seem unfair to bend to thier demands but this is life. I will wait patienly for my time off to cleared by the manager.
I would ask my colleague if he booked anywhere to stay. Also did he need a flight to get to his destination. If it wasn't a big deal I would just make plans to take the other time off from work.
I would be willing to change my plans, but would expect something in return. I would attempt to negotiate for an extra day's vacation or some other small reward for making the change. I would do this because I believe in compromise, give and take, and being rewarded for doing the right thing.
