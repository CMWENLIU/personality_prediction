I would let my colleague have their vacation, but I would make sure to let my supervisor know that I'm being the bigger person.  I'd also ask for first dibs on vacation time if a new conflict ever arises in the future.  I'd hope that my colleague would be appreciative of my sacrifice.
I would let my colleague take it if they are so insistent upon it. I could take it another week and I'd be doing a solid for someone else which is always good. It would give me more time to plan my vacation as well.
I would take the liberty to change my plans. I don't mind working an extra week, so long as I get my time. So long as business runs smoothly, I'm happy.
It would depend on who has been there the longest and if my plans could be changed; if I have an airline ticket or reservations than cannot be changed without penalty, I would fight it. If I can change them without losing money and the co worker is someone I normally get along with, I would change my vacation.
I would see if I could change my vacation plans to another week because that would be the easiest way to deal with the situation. I would talk to my family to see if they are okay with that because their schedules have to sync up with mine. I would talk to my colleague to see if there is anything I can do to get them to change it because sometimes people can change their minds if you present them with an alternative they like.
I would change my week, as long as I had no pressing plans. If I am taking vacation for a specific event, I would talk to my coworker and see if we could compromise. But if I was just vacationing to relax, I would not care about changing my vacation.
If I hadn’t already booked my trip (I usually travel on Amtrak), I would be willing to change my dates.  But I would want to know from the supervisor, when my co-worker put in her request for vacation.  If I put mine in sooner and had already made all my plans, I would probably tell her that my plans are complete and I put in my request before he/she did and my co-worker would have to change her dates.
I would try and change my plans for the week if my colleague couldn't do so. Maybe there was an important reason why she couldn't take a different week. If I could do it without any repercussions, I would change my week. It's not the end of the world. I'm still getting a week vacation and would be thankful for that alone.
I would change my vacation plans. I would reschedule my vacation a week or two after he came back. I would ask him to let me know when he is planning on taking a vacation in order to avoid any future conflicts. I would also let him in on my vacation plans.
I would change my vacation week. I would do so because I'd want to be a team player. However I would make a point with my colleague and supervisor that I want credit for being accommodating now should I need some flexibility for time off in the future.
I would attempt to plead my case to my colleague and supervisor. I would be prepared to concede the vacation week if it really isn't possible for my colleague to do so, and the workplace would really be too understaffed.
I would try to work out a compromise with the other employee first, to see if we could both take part of the week off. If this did not work out, I would try to change my plans and work this week to accommodate the other person. However, if I gave up my vacation, I would inform my manager so they know that I was being a good teammate.
I would speak to my supervisor to see who requested the vacation first. If it was my colleague, then I would agree to change my week. If it was me who requested it first, I would tell my supervisor that it's only fair that my colleague change his request.
I would ask my supervisor who receives priority over the vacation. If I requested first, then I will continue to argue that I should receive the vacation. If my co-worker requested first, then I would gladly give up my spot but try to encourage him/her to give up the next spot. It's like the co-worker would owe me.
I would change my vacation dates, so long as it wasn't too big of a hassle. If I already had my hotel booked as well as flight and all that I would not change plans. If it was earlier on and I could still get my deposit back in my plane ticket I would be willing to change vacation days.
I would try to speak with my coworker and see if they'd budge, or at least meet me halfway by perhaps delaying their vacation week by a few days. If not, I'd talk to my manager to see who asked for the vacation week off first. If that all fails, I'd probably just move my vacation to a different week, because by then I'd imagine I'd be sick of fighting over it, honestly.
If I had plans that could be changed, I would change them and take vacation during a different week. If my plans could not be changed, I would inform my supervisor of that. I would not discuss it with the co-worker, as the outcome is not his decision.
I would likely change my vacation plans to a different week, probably the week after. I feel like it's not worth fighting over and I would enjoy my vacation the same regardless of what week it's on. I think it must be important for them to have the vacation on that week and I don't want to make things hard on them.
I would explain to my colleague that I also have vacation plans that can't be moved. I would explain that I have a unique family situation that requires me to take that week off, and it would be a significant hardship to move my plans. In fact, it could not be done at all. I would also reason with my colleague that I haven't taken vacation in a longer time than him, and thus should have my vacation plans stand. I would take a pretty hard stance on this because I shouldn't be the one to budge if my colleague has similar or worse reasons for not budging.
I would take a look at my own schedule to see if it was more mobile. As it is likely that is is, I would change my schedule.  If I could not change it, I would try to work out a compromise. If that failed, I would ask my supervisor who requested first.
I would change my vacation plans if it didn't inconvenience me.  If it inconvenienced me I would ask our supervisor to decide who gets the desired vacation time.  If still not satisfactory I would consider offering money to the colleague if I was really serious.  Otherwise if I got my way, I would let the colleague get their way the next time.
I would change my vacation plans and let my colleague take his/her vacation on the week that I had planned my vacation. It doesn't make sense to cause workplace tensions over leisure activities. If I were to try and fight with my colleague over who gets to take vacation, it would only complicate our relationship and make things worse in the long run. I feel that by conceding, I not only avoid unnecessary tension, I improve my standing with my supervisor. If any conflicts arise in the future, I will be able to point to this particular incident to show that I had already made a concession and that other people will need to reciprocate to maintain fairness in the workplace.
I would look to see how important the week I needed off was. Then I would change if it wasn't important. If it was important, then I would make a case to my colleague and my boss to explain why.
I would let them have the vacation if and only if my plans could be delayed. Otherwise, I would hopefully have gained enough favor with my supervisor to convince him/her to give me the vacation. I would also start looking for another job if this became a big issue.
I would talk to my supervisor about the situation. I would ask to see if there was some sort of solution. If I was the first to request vacation I would not back down and let them have it. If it came to it, I would see if we could do a draw to solve it.
Change my dates and then talk smack about them when they leave. Fill up in rage there that week while overdosing on black coffee. When they come back just stare at them at there cube.
I would change my vacation week, because I am a better employee than he or she. We can't both be off work at the same time because then the other people at work would suffer because of our selfishness. Also, the other employee/ or even my boss now kind of owes me...
I would change it. Unless they have been on vacation more recently than I have,
I would seek to change my own plans. I'm generally not confrontational and would attempt to avoid disagreement. If this would not work, I would possibly try to find someone to cover my shift, if acceptable.
I would not change my vacation plans. The reason being is that I asked for the vacation time off first. So the coworker will have no choice but to change their plans.
I would talk to them about why I need the vacation and not budge. It's extremely unsettling to plan something and have to move. Chances are those days were planned way in advance
I would change my vacation time because there's no reason to get in a argument. It would just cause more problems for me that are unneeded. I don't think it would hurt me much to change my date.
I would look at different dates to switch my vacation days to. I would also plan my next vacation days early on so that I would have first dibs. I would also resent my co-worker for being stubborn and plan to not help them the next time they need it.
I would probably try to change my vacation plans.  If that isn't possible, due to having reservations that can't be cancelled or something like that, then I may try to pay the coworkers some money to change their plans.  If that doesn't work, then I may just have to skip out on vacation.
I'd surrender and take my vacation another week then. I believe in keeping things chill at work, and not creating waves. It's not a big deal to change my plans. So in the spirit of cooperation, I would just surrender to my colleague's plans.
I would see if I could change my vacation plans. Then if I couldn't I would try and bribe the employee to change their plans. And if none of that worked, I would call in sick for a week, and just go on my vacation. If they want to fire me they can, because I'm too good for this place anyway, and I'll find another job in no time.
I would probably change mine. I am the nicer person. I don't really go far on vacation anyway. So it would be me to change.
I would first ask another co worker for advice about this colleague to see if it is worth talking to him or her about changing the vacation.  Also, I would has my supervisor what is the plan if both of us don't want to change our vacations.  Also, it would depend if my vacation was to go anywhere or if it was just to stay at home so maybe I could change my date.  Probably I would want to change mine because I don't like conflict at work.
I would change my vacation plans only if I had not paid money that was non refundable or transferable. It depends how far in the future the vacation time was scheduled. I’m pretty flexible usually, so unless the vacation time had an important purpose, I would be okay switching times.
I would talk to the colleague and ask him/her if he/she had actually made travel reservations already. If he/she had not then I would try and talk her/him into changing his vacation week to another week. If the colleague would still not change his/her vacation week, then I would try to change my vacation week to another week.
I would first see if seniority counted and if I had more I would insist I get it if there was a rule. If it didn't matter that much to me I would just pick a different a different week.
I would change my week of vacation.  I would also talk to my boss to ensure that he or she is aware that my coworker is NOT willing to change his vacation plans.  I would also be more likely to refuse to assist my coworker should any future circumstances arise in which he or she would require help.
I would check to see if my plans can be changed, or if the occasion is rigid in schedule (simply leisure versus a friend's wedding, for example), and if flexible, I would offer to change my vacation request.  If my plans were rigid, I would ask my coworker if he or she might be able to change his or her plans.  If my coworker also had rigid plans, I would try to determine a fair way to choose one of us to change plans (a coin toss, or other criteria that is mutually decided).
I would go ahead and just change my vacation date. I wouldn't want to cause any trouble.  I would just cave in and  do it so that it is easier.
I would try to fight for my vacation if I had already plans to travel, but otherwise I would back down and take vacations another time. Or I would propose to leave it to fate with a fair coin flip.
I would discuss with him where is he planning to go, who's he going with, what's the purpose of the trip. Pretty much all those things, also consider who went for vacation last time, is there any vacation soon
I would quit my job, because my personal time is more important to me than a job that won't let me take time off. What reason do I have to care if it'll be busy when I'm away? Why should I have to sell my soul to some corporation because, uh oh, things might be slightly slower for customers because there's less people working.
I would change my plans and schedule my vacation later because someone has to be flexible. It would also benefit me to show my supervisor that I'm the one willing to accommodate others and would show that I'm a team player.
I would ask the supervisor which one of us put in the request first.  If I put in the request first, I would expect to be given first priority.  If my colleague put in their request first, then I would choose a different slot.
I would give my colleague the week I had wanted for vacation. I'm not bothered by waiting longer. And I'd rather not cause tension at my job.
I would request to my supervisor to look into who made the request first to take this week off for vacation. If my co-worker put in the request first I would be okay with changing my week. If I were the one to submit the request prior to my co-worker then I would request that being taken under consideration and I would refuse to change my plans.
I would not be willing to change my vacation plans.  Why should I?  The supervisor can do their job and make the decision.
I would first try to reason with my colleague and find out why they wouldn't change their plans.  Next, I would see if I could push my own plans back a week, so that my colleague would have their time off. And finally, if I could not, I would get the boss involve and have them award the time by seniority.
I would do my best to change my vacation plans, as long as I hadn't already booked something that couldn't be refunded. I would try to be flexible since my coworker is not being flexible. I would feel frustrated, but I would do my best to make the situation work out for everyone involved.
I would change my vacation plans but tell my colleague that he owes me a favor.
I would first ask if there was anyone available to replace me. If not, then I would work that week. I would choose to do that because I would at least want to know if the vacation was possible but wouldn't want to lose my job either.
I would be willing to change my plans if I had not booked anything in advance.  I would make sure that my colleague knows that I had sacrificed this time for him/her.  I would let the supervisor know that I had done the other colleague a favor.
I would not change my vacation plans. Workers are entitled to go on vacation when they want to. Plus, my plans would likely already be cemented and I wouldn't change that because of a pushy supervisor.
I would change my vacation. I wanted to have more time to plan a better trip.
I would think about what I was planning to use my vacation time for. If it was something that could be easily rearranged (for example, a staycation or something I didn't have reservations for), I would offer to pick another week. If I needed it to be that week, I would try to explain the situation to my supervisor to try to get to keep the week.
I would first talk to the colleague and ask them why I should be expected to change my vacation plans if they are unwilling to. I wouldn't back down, but if they were not willing to agree, I'd explain the situation to the manager and let him decide. I believe whoever requested vacation for that week first should be the one who gets it. The question seems to make it sound like I asked for it first, but either way, I would find that decision to be the fair one.
I do not like changing my vacation plans. Here I do not see much choice, however. So I would bite the bullet to avoid being seen as a troublemaker.
I would make sure what was fair was carried out. I really want vacation this week. So who put in the request first should get to go.
I would be the bigger person and take a different week for my vacation. It sounds like my colleague, for whatever reason, can't change their vacation, so I would let them have the week off. I'm a pretty flexible person, and unless I had nonrefundable tickets to something, I wouldn't really care what week I had off. In general, I can't afford to take a vacation where I'd be going anywhere on a trip by plane, so I could probably take my vacation anytime.
I would try maybe talking to the colleague and make sure they cant change their plans. If not then I would have to change my week request for maybe another week. Thought this would be very upsetting.
I would change my dates as long as I would not be losing any money that was already paid towards a vacation trip, such as plane tickets.  I am a fairly flexible person and I don't have many family commitments so I am comfortable changing the date of my vacation.  I might talk to my colleague about what favor they might do for me since I am willing to change my plans, like covering for me in the future for a day off.
I would first look at my own vacation plans and see if they are changeable. If I were able to move my vacation, I would easily compromise and tell my coworker they could have the week. If I could not move my vacation, I would start to make a case for why I needed this week and why I deserved it based on past performance and work history. I would then take the case to my supervisor and let them decide.
I would see who requested the week off first.  I think that whoever requested the week off last should be the person to change their vacation plans.  I might be willing to change my plans if I can do so without change fees or it wasn't completely necessary that I be somewhere for something specific.
Unless I had some important trip planned, I would request for a different week of vacation. Maybe just the week before of after my colleague. If I do have something already planned for the week I will also not move my vacation week.
If I was able to change my plans I would.  If I was not able to change my plans, I would find out who asked first and then that person should be allowed to take off. I would be super frustrated and try and handle it well.
I would fight for my preferred days off. We might negotiate and meet each other half way. If necessary, I'd get a third party involved.
I would first approach my colleague and try to work things out. It would be convenient if my colleague were to change their plans, but that doesn't seem to be the case. If my colleague's plans are really that important, then I would just change my vacation to another week.
I wouldn't back down.  My vacation is just as important as someone else  s.  I would stand my ground.  If the supervisor made me take a different week I would call in sick on the week I wanted the vacation.
I would see who put in for the week first. If it was me, I would either negotiate to get some advantage in passing up my week for another or stick with keeping my current week. If I had plans for that week with someone else, I would not want to have to cancel because of this problem.
As long as I didn't have any vacation plans for that week, or anything that I was not able to change, I would take a different week off for vacation.
I would change the week of my vacation. As long as I didn't have to make cancellations that would cost me money, or miss going to something that could not be rescheduled, it wouldn't be too big of a deal for me. I wouldn't consider it worth the time and energy to argue with my colleague over who gets the vacation week.
I would take my vacation later. It really is not a big deal to me, I can wait. Also, I prefer to keep the peace rather than incite disagreement or any kind of social friction. Working well as a team is very important.
I would first take a close look at my vacation plans to see if they would be easy to change. If so, I would likely switch my vacation to a different week since it would not matter much to me. In the event that my plans could not change without great inconvenience or cost, the course of action would depend on the order in which the vacations were requested -- if I had requested the vacation first, I would mention this to the colleague and insist that they must change their schedule.
I would maybe see who has worked there longer. I would maybe see who has higher ranking at the company. I would see if I could get a better deal on my vacation A different date.
I would ask if I could work remotely from wherever I planned to go for my vacation. If so, then I would just deal with it and work while away, as I would not want to be confrontational. However, if I could not work remotely during this time, then I would talk to my colleague about our plans and see if we can't reach some agreement.
I would accede and change my vacation plans. I would make sure that my supervisor somehow knew it was me who changed their plans. I would like knowing that my coworker sort of "owes me one" for doing this for him/her.
I would first discern how mutable my plans were. If I didn't have any friends or family counting on me being off that week, I wouldn't mind changing. If I had already made plans or reservations, I would speak with my supervisor. Presumably I had already requested the week off and should have priority because of it
I would tell my boss that he should go by seniority as to who would get the week off. When I make vacation plans I want to stick to them, It would be very difficult to change my plans once I have made them, I do realize that the other person might have seniority over me
I would ask my wife if she had already planned a trip or purchased something for that week. I would be willing to be flexible unless the trip was related to her chemotherapy, in which case I would take the time of as medical leave.
I would let them have their time and pick another time. I can almost always change my plans, so it is not a big problem. I would rather get along than fight with someone so it really would not be a problem.
I would determine how important my vacation was to me. If it was just relaxing at home, I would be a lot more willing to change my vacation week. If it was planned out far in advance with money already put down I would be much less likely to change my plans. It would also depend on their plans, and how difficult they would be to change the date on. I would ask the supervisor who requested off first, because whoever asked first should get it.
I would try to change my plans to the week before or the week after the desired dates.  If my colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans, I would have to assume that there is a reason (e.g., nonrefundable plane tickets, others involved).  In my opinion, it is not worth losing the friendship of coworkers over something that can be changed.
I would not be willing to change my vacation time unless it was absolutely necessary. Vacations in my family take a lot of time to plan and I would not be willing to disrupt our plans. Additionally, I would suggest to my supervisor to give it to the person who put in the time first, which probably would be me since I planned this trip so early.
I would change my vacation. It is a reasonable request to have once of us change our week. If my colleague could not or would not change their plans, then I would.
I would allow them to have their vacation time. I would then request vacation for the next week and add an extra day to my request just because i could. The inconvenience of scheduling warrants an extra day.
I would agree to move my holidays because I hate arguing.  I would agree to move my vacation because I have not planned anything yet.  I would agree to move my holidays, but the next time my needs come first.
I would stay and work. It is important for us to all make sacrifices. This would be my way of contributing to the team and be helpful to others.
I would talk to my colleague and see what they were doing for their vacation. I would do what I could to try and rearrange my schedule to get the time off I needed. I would also talk to my manager to see if there was anything else that could be done.
I would change my plans.  I would do it to avoid conflict in the workplace.  I would feel too stressed out if I did not accommodate somebody.
I would react differently depending on which one of us requested the vacation time first. If my colleague request first then I would allow him or her to go. If I ask first then I would allow my colleague to go.
I would not change my plans either. I would make the boss decide which one of us were to go on vacation. If they aren't willing to talk and work something out with me then why should I go out of my own way?
I would take one for the team and change my vacation date due to the stubbornness of my colleague. I would do this in order to avoid any drama and bitterness. It would make working together less stressful and would be the fastest way to move on.
I would insist that the vacation week should be taken by whichever one of us requested it first. I would believe that if my colleague is not willing to change their plans, I should not be expected to be willing to change mine. I would probably feel negatively about this colleague following the incident.
I would talk to my colleague about it, especially if I was the one who made the plans first. If I did not make my plans first, then I would try to be flexible and plan for vacationing at a different time. But if this was a colleague that I didn't like, then I would not cave under any circumstances whatsoever.
I would agree to have whatever vacation time would be convenient for everyone else (I have no family). My last vacation was May, 1988. Why complain? I have no sick leave or other days off (I work six days a week as a USPS contract Mail Carrier, and am considered to be "self-employed", although paid by the USPS!)
I would schedule my vacation for another week. My colleague may have important plans for that week. So, I would allow them to take that week off and schedule my vacation for another time.
I would go ahead and switch my vacation. I never make concrete plans before getting approved from work. So it would be no problem unless it is something like a family reunion or something. I would then try to compromise with the other employee.
I would want the supervisor to make the definitive decision. I would hope that she would choose the person who turned in their time off first. I do not like that the supervisor put the decision in the employees hands as that is their responsibility. I would also make plans as if I needed to change my vacation just so that I would be an easy transition and I would not have to sacrifice my overall plans if I needed to change dates.
I would just accept it has is, and take the next week with a but that he has to owe me a favor of my choosing. Like for a example switching a day of work when I need to call in sick. Perhaps helping me with an assignment that has a strict deadline or something of that nature.
I would change my vacation plans to accommodate my coworker. I would feel it is important to keep harmony on the team. I would also want to demonstrate that I am a good employee.
I would go ahead and change my dates. I would do it so as to be the nice person willing to do the change in my bosses eyes. As far as my coworker goes i would let her know next time thiis happens they change their date not me.
Vacation plans are often planned in advance. These plans often require reservations, bought plane tickets or other transportation, and planned around events. Changing the dates around these planned events would be more than an inconvenience. Due to that, I would change my vacation time if I had no plans to travel.
I would take a different week off. I always figure out my vacation in advance of making travel arrangements.  I am flexible and my coworker is not but I would not care.
I would want to know the reason for my colleague's unwillingness to change plans. Non-refundable tickets? Family coming to town? Some things take precedence over others.
I would talk to my family first, and see whether our plans could be changed. However, I would also talk to my co-worker, and see if there is a way that we could compromise. If we cannot reach an agreement, then I'll talk to my family and see how flexible we can be with our plans. I would be angry with my co-worker, but also realized that sometimes plans have to change.
If my plans weren't that important I would just be the bigger person , and let them have the week of vacation. If it was something that i had planned for a while , though . I would talk further with my boss , and try to come to a better conclusion .I might offer to work over time on my return from vacation to persuade my boss into letting me have the time off .
I would be the one to change my vacation, because I prefer that it be less busy at work.
I would want to know why my colleague cannot change his/her plans.  If he/she has something booked for that week and I do not have any specific plans, I would be glad to choose another week off.  If my colleague has no specific plans he/she has already made, though, I would think that whoever has seniority should get that week off.
I would try to come up with a compromise. Depending on the situation, I would discuss options with my colleague. Maybe we can work out a deal where I take vacation at a different time in exchange for a favor. Or we could possibly split the days available for us to take vacations.
I would consider my vacation plans and see if it is crucial that I take time off work to attend to my plans. If my plans are changeable or could be done at a later date, then I will oblige and let my colleague take the time off. If I cannot change my plans, then I would ask my supervisor to consider which colleague they think deserves to take the time off more after we both send in a written explanation on why we need the time off for that particular week.
I would try to figure out if either of us had plans for that week scheduled. If there are any nonrefundable deposits already paid, or if it is just unfeasible to reschedule. Taking that info I would decide whether I was going allow them to take the vacation time or take the issue to management.
I would compare my plans with my colleague first and see whether them or I have something important to attend, like a wedding or something involving children. If they are still unwilling to budge, I would then consult my family about what to do regarding the issue. I would make it a point to say that my colleague is unwilling to change their vacation plans and my supervisor is putting pressure on me.
I would be ok with it if I didn't have plans. If I had made plans I would speak to my supervisor. I would explain that I had the time scheduled first.
What I would do depends on a number of factors. For instance, who requested vacation first? How long ago were the vacations scheduled. Who is really responsible for them being scheduled at the same time. However, if the colleague began the conversation by saying that he is not willing to change then I would also refuse to change. I would do this because there is no reason to be reasonable when the other party is being unreasonable and the real problem is that someone allowed the vacations to be scheduled at the same time in the first place.
I would take one for the team and agree to change my plans. I don't really care that much about vacations anyway, so changing the time wouldn't be a huge burden on me. I'd rather make the sacrifice to ensure that I don't lose the favor of my colleague. I feel that will make work less unpleasant for me going forward.
I would be a good sport and agree to take my vacation later. I don't like conflict, and don't need conflict at my workplace. I would expect my colleague to believe that he/she owes me one, though.
I would talk to the supervisor and tell them I will reschedule my vacation time for a more convenient time. I would be happy with that.
I would talk with my spouse about changing the week of our vacation.  If he is set on that particular week, I would discuss it with my supervisor.  I would also discuss it with my co-worker.
I would probably let them take the vacation time if it wasn't anything I could reschedule. I would also let them know that they owe me. I don't think I would particularly be mad or upset as I am a flexible person.
I would talk to my family members and see if a different week would work for my vacation.  I would also talk to the colleage and find out why they are not willing to change their vacation plans and see if we could avoid something like this in the future so that we don't have to change our plans at the last minute.  I would most likely end up changing my request for vacation to a different week because I don't like conflict and confrontation.  I would try to make things work and be flexible because I think things are better in life if you can have some flexibility.
